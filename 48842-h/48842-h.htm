<h2>HOT SKETCH <a id="NO_1"></a>NO. 1<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Plant Cured of Mossbackitis</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>


<p class='drop-cap'>OUT among the gnarled oaks of Squirrel
Cove there buzzed a busy manufacturing
plant.</p>

<p>It had been established since Time wore a
bib, and, as far back as History could recall,
had been handed down from Whiskers to Whiskers
without a break.</p>

<p>The same old Superintendent with his chew
of Fine Cut tucked away in a back-cavity, was
always on hand each generation to bury the
father and drill the son into the mysteries of
Production and Distribution. Old Faithful used
to love to take off his beaver cap and stroke
the top of his glazed Summit while he told some
eager visitor all about the industrial heirloom
and his long and watchful connection with it.</p>

<p>In the course of centuries the Concern had
of course worked up some business around the
County, but at no time did there ever occur
what you would call a Sensational Increase in
trade. In fact, careful scrutiny revealed nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in the whole town that could be associated
with a sensation of any kind.</p>

<p>The annual output of the particular Hive of
Industry under discussion went wholly to Old
Customers who had been buying regularly since
Washington hurdled the Delaware. If any attempt
was ever made to get New Business it
was altogether an unconscious act, and no record
of the perpetrator remains.</p>

<p>At the time of which we are now yodeling,
the current Owner and Proprietor was closing
in on his sixty-fifth Milestone, and, like his
father and grandfather before him, he believed
in letting Well Enough alone until it crawled
up and bit him in the leg. Then he would roll
over on the other side.</p>

<p>It is only natural that such a highly strung
temperament as this should be accompanied by
more or less radically advanced views on Business
in general. This was indeed the case, yes.
And he was a horrible spendthrift when it came
to Advertising. In the course of say two lunar
years his total linage amounted to about as
much as a Fourth Avenue delicatessen. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
never counted the cost of any plant installation
under one figure.</p>

<p>If anybody had suggested travelling the
Trade, the proposition would have met with the
same enthusiastic endorsement that a Shell
Game would get at a Dunkard picnic.</p>

<p>All salesmen were looked upon as a species of
unclassified bandit that victimized Firms and
Customers alike, and revelled at nights with
Champagne, Chickens and Chant.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that our Captain of Industry
had a daughter. In looks she was
strictly neutral, and in intelligence just sort of
medio-semi. Her heart was laced to a young
Scrod she had met when she was East at School
learning to parry and thrust with knife and
fork.</p>

<p>She had never seen anything like this rollicking
Young Buck from one end of her shaved-neck
County to the other, and so she went limp
the first time he threw a ray in her direction.
He was a thoroughbred at that, and could get
in and out of a Taxi without furring up his Top
Hat, and pay a dinner check without stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his story and then forgetting afterward what
he was talking about.</p>

<p>It required no profound psychoanalysis to
tell from Daughter’s manner that there was
only one kernel in the crib so far as she was
concerned. As for the tall-collared gentry of
Squirrel Cove, the entries were closed and they
knew it to a man and gave her the whole runway.</p>

<p>Now ever since Daughter was a baby blowing
bubbles out of the corners of her mouth,
Papa had lived in Mortal Dread of a day when
she might buckle up with a man who would be
only after his Thirty Dollars which he had
slowly and painfully piled up through pluck,
perseverance and pre-natal pull. And so when
he saw her temperature rising and her appetite
falling, he dug out her secret and then
started on a quiet hunt to find out whether the
daring Disturber was Grade A, or tinnif.</p>

<p>As he had feared, the Rat proved to be a
Baltimore Luncher pulling down Fifteen Dollars
per week and washing his own clothes in
the bath tub.</p>

<p>This discovery caused a Family Upheaval
which for pep, polish and all-round proficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
had all Mexican Mixups looking like a harmless
after-school scamper at Hop Scotch.</p>

<p>Every evening at sundown when Father
would come home from the din and roar of his
quarter-acre Plant, the neighbors would gather
at their windows for the latest war news. Sometimes
the Carranzaists would be on top; at other
times the Villaists and Zapaists would have it.</p>

<p>Daughter protested hotly during these Bloody
Encounters that her king was Poor but Honest,
but father had him sized up as a Single Cylinder.</p>

<p>One night when the walls were being freshly
inlaid with flying furniture and bric-a-brac,
Daughter ducked out of the peaceful abode and
down to the Railway Station and caught the
Milk Train for New York. The following Wednesday
at 4 P. M., Kendallville Time, she took
Philip Darlington Wakefield for Better or
Worse and wired Father for his blessing and
$100 to come back home on.</p>

<p>At first Father was all for raising his hand
to High Heaven and pronouncing the Irish Cottage
Curse with all the spine-chilling heroics
about darkening the Threshold, but Mother
looked quietly over her goggles and told him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cut the cheap melodramatic stuff and behave like
a white man, and tell the Young Folks to buy
a couple of postcards of the Woolworth Building
and come back home.</p>

<p>Under this stinging philippic Father melted
into the big armchair and became human, and
a couple of days later the Bride and Groom
blew into Squirrel Cove and turned all Main
Street into little groups of excited goatees.</p>

<p>Philip Darlington gave Father the first Hoyo
he had ever smoked and took the old gazunk
completely off his underpinning by showing a
knowledge of Industry and Finance that only
a Fifteen Dollar New York clerk can possess.
On the strength of it he landed a job in Father’s
mighty Works and wasn’t there a week before
every yunk in the place was plotting for his
destruction.</p>

<p>The reason, tersely and succinctly expressed,
was that Phil proved to have Ideas and nobody
around the Works cared to deliberately expose
himself to the danger of infection. But Phil
went right ahead and shifted men and things
here, there and everywhere, and put in Time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Clocks and Cost Systems and all kinds of efficiency
effects.</p>

<p>He took the dusty correspondence off the long
wire and had it filed in steel filing cabinets, and
reduced the length of the Daily Conference from
three cigars to one cigar. He relieved the Shipping
Clerk of the Sales end of the Business, and
established a separate Purchasing Department,
thereby lifting this important work from the
shoulders of the Night Watchman.</p>

<p>Phil also got out the first and only Catalogue
the concern had ever had in all their 4,000
years of aggressive Trade Building, and had
the whole force threatening to strike when he
announced that he was going out for New Business.</p>

<p>After a twenty-one round Go with Father-in-Law
over the revolutionary question of Advertising,
Phil got in touch with a Big Agency
and listened to them reel off the usual now-you-want-to-start-off-with-a-page-in-the-Saturday-Evening-Post
advice, after which he proceeded
to map out his own campaign as is Customary
with the Laity about to advertise.</p>

<p>Phil also had to back Father-in-Law up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
against the silo and sew up both his eyes and
put a pair of vacuum-cup lips on him before
he could get the Old Man to see the necessity of
sending a force of bright-eyed Salesmen out on
the Road to sell the Stuff. Phil said there was
no use manufacturing a good article and then
keeping it a secret.</p>

<p>Every day there was something unusual doing
around the Works, and of course it was all very
thrilling, but when the bills began to roll in,
Father-in-Law threw thirty different kinds of
foaming spasm, followed by Sinking Spells that
threatened to lay him ’neath the Mossy Mound.
But Phil was always there with the pulmotor
and the Soothing Word to pull him through.</p>

<p>One day when everybody around the Office
was getting all ready for the Last Sad Rites on
account of all this frenzied expense, business
suddenly began to pour in like beer out of a
busted vat. Consternation thereupon Reigned
Supreme and acted like a drunken sailor.</p>

<p>The little Plant squeaked and groaned and
heaved and puffed until it fairly burst its little
panties trying to keep up with Orders. All
Squirrel Cove, from the Mayor down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Poundmaster, was given a job at something or
other, and Phil was heralded all the way from
Angusville to Jowett Junction as the greatest
Organizing Genius the County had ever known.</p>

<p>When the Fiscal Year ended and Father-in-Law
took a happy peep at the Balance Sheet
and saw that he had holed-out more coin than
all his Ancestors put together, he called Phil
to his parental side and shifted the following
Beautiful Tribute from his proud bosom:</p>

<p>“My boy,” he said, “I feel like a tan-eyed
gnat for having charted you up as a parasite
when I first saw you looming up on the Links.
I thought you were marrying my daughter just
to romp off with her father’s little Yen Bag. I
would have thought the same of any man who
didn’t have a few crullers of his own. I didn’t
realize that there might be a chance of my getting
a dumsight more out of you than you could
ever get out of me. Henceforth you are a fifty
percent owner of this Dugout, and what’s more,
here is a little present for you in recognition of
your sterling worth.”</p>

<p>Phil stood the cotton umbrella in a corner
and soled off to break the gladsome tidings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
his wife and found her tossing tennis balls with
some Tea Toad in a green Sport Coat. Later
Phil spied the two walking together through
the Big Grove and she was listing to starboard.</p>

<p>“H’m,” he h’md, “I’ve got the Old Man, but
it’s cost me the gal.”</p>

<p>He turned sadly away, mumbling something
about what he thought of a Life that kept a fellow
always manoeuvering for position.</p>

<p>Over the hills came the floating fragrance of
frying fishballs, while in the tall whiffletree
above him a chipmunk chipped softly to its mate.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>A &nbsp; YOUNG man had a job with an old organization.</p>

<p>The job was not that of General Manager.</p>

<p>Nor was it Department Manager.</p>

<p>It was not a managership of any kind, character,
quality or description—all claims to the
contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>It was just a job.</p>

<p>It was the kind of job that any young man
with an eye on ideas and a finger on the future,
might have with any old Organization steeped
in stability and pickled in policy.</p>

<p>In other less alliterative language, we might
smooth down our shirt-front and say that the
young man had A Chance.</p>

<p>If we cared to toss off all restraint and emphasize
the statement with grape-juice profanity,
we might say that the young man had a
Very, Very good chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>But he didn’t know how to take care of his
chance.</p>

<p>He took chances with his Chance.</p>

<p>And one day it got away from him.</p>

<p>When the Boss handed him his passports, he
asked for an explanation, and the Boss passed
him one, medium well done.</p>

<p>It ran as per follows, WITNESSETH:</p>

<p>“Young Man,” heaved the Boss, scratching
his right ear pleasingly with his left thumb,
“the reason we are decorating you with the
Order of the Canned is because we have found
that YOU LEAK. And any concern that does
not plug the leak the moment they locate it, will
soon be sitting around garter-high in the mire
of misunderstanding.</p>

<p>“Were it not for the red-nosed fact that here
and there in this Organization is a man foolish
enough to be loyal to the institution that enables
him to close down his troubles when he closes
down his desk, the whole Office would by now
be torn with internal strife like a rat-tailed
Roadster, and we would be headed for the rocks
of riot and rebellion.</p>

<p>“Your up-stairs piping is so defective that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
everything you take in at the ears runs out of
your mouth. You hear one man spill some remark
about another, and you scamper off with
your little red eyes to tell the other.</p>

<p>“Then when the other comes back with a rib-rocker
on the first man, you scamper back again
and break the news to Number One.</p>

<p>“The other day you eared-in on a conversation
I was having with my partner about one
of our men, and in exactly eleven minutes by
our beloved Office Clock the whole Force had
tabulated the tidings.</p>

<p>“Before I had a chance to talk to the man
myself, he came at me with the logical deduction
that he had a right to be informed at first
hands on a matter concerning himself that
seemed to be as well known around the Works
as the hour for Knocking off Work.</p>

<p>“And WITNESSETH: Sometimes when
Party of the First Part has been discussing
important matters in conference with himself
or others, you have hopped around like a coolie
with the dhobe itch, trying to sniff out some clue
on which to ground a bit of gab.</p>

<p>“I have never walked through the office that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I did not spot you back of a door holding a
whisper-fest with somebody, and, if my memory
isn’t fooling me, we have never yet talked here
in the office about lifting or lopping prices, or
changing selling plans, or shuffling Salesmen,
or shaking up the territory, that it has not leaked
out to the Road Robbins long before we wanted
it to.</p>

<p>“We now know for a cinchety that you are
the guilty goop because you fell for a plant that
we had cleverly framed up with the kindly assistance
of myself.</p>

<p>“AND, since we propose to run this roost
harmoniously—radiating a wee wisp of sunshine
and fellowship wherever we can, and making
Business a pleasure instead of a punch-up—there
does not seem to be any place around these
puritanical precincts for a leaky radiator.</p>

<p>“You are bright and clever, and you don’t
injure your spine trying to get out of the path
of an idea, and, by all the rules but one, you
should shoot right to the top of any business.</p>

<p>“The one rule that you have not yet sponged
up is that Success is more than brains and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
bustle. Success is the art of closing up the
Exhaust occasionally.</p>

<p>“I can find no doubt in any hole or corner
of my mind that you have many times scratched
your busy little head and wondered why you
have remained in the same job all these centuries
while other men not so clever as your
oblique self have sailed right past you into the
harbor of Heavy Responsibility With Correspondingly
Light Pay. The reason is as stated
in yon foregoing.</p>

<p>“Be it known to you further that no Business
can succeed without Loyalty and Co-operation.
Modern Business demands of every man that he
be loyal, or be off.</p>

<p>“Pin-headedness, tale-peddling and office politics
are barnacles on the barque of Business,
and the Firm that does not scrape them off is
doomed to decay.</p>

<p>“Any man with a brow an inch over all,
should know that the lot of the Leaker means
to be ultimately despised by the very men he
has made confidants of.</p>

<p>“Every time you have started one of those
he-said-that-you-said-that-I-said stories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
yours, you have rawed up all the decent men
of this Office.</p>

<p>“Today you stand about as popular around
here as a hair in the butter; but you don’t know
it, because, like all back-fence babblers, you are
foggy up on the perceptive plane, and you think
that the man who listens must like yourself be
loose.</p>

<p>“Some day you will learn, young man, that
a tight tongue makes a sagacious sky-piece—that
to speak well is to cheat hell—that the
chain of Successful Business is linked with
loyalty—and the Leaker lands in Limbo long
before the last lap’s run.</p>

<p>“Thanking you for your kind attention, and
asking you to now kindly consider yourself sunk
without warning, I beg to remain etc, etc.”</p>

<p>Having spake after the manner of the hereinbefore
mentioned, Comrade Boss removed his
eyes from the transgressor, and wheeled around
in his chair.</p>

<p>And, taking his pen between his index finger
and the back of his hand, began to sign yesterday’s
mail.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was a Large Employer with fantail
whiskers who got good and sore at
his Help.</p>

<p>They didn’t have the interests of the business
At Heart, he said. All they cared about was
to fist-in their salaries and see that the Office
Clock was accurate.</p>

<p>Any time any of them did any dweedling
little thing in the shape of exceptional work,
they expected credit for it, he murmured.</p>

<p>If the Sales Manager pulled up his sales, he
would pull down his vest and bid for congratulations.</p>

<p>If the Credit Man lost only 1/40th of 1 per
cent on the year’s accounts, he would dodge
around in front of the throne expecting to be
caught and laureled.</p>

<p>If a stenographer got her dictation at four
o’clock, and then jumped into the saddle and
won the race before Big Whistle, she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
expect her Dictator to say she was Some little
hustlerine.</p>

<p>Even the Office Squirrel looked for commendation
every time he discharged the responsibilities
of his Office without fumble or fizzle.</p>

<p>What this Employer wanted, he contended,
was employees who would work for the good of
the Business and not be always thinking about
their own good. He said he hadn’t a man
around the place who could sink Self with the
rock of Gibraltar tied around its neck. The
reward for doing a good thing, he preached,
was in having done it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now it so happened that Our Hero was a
Town Pillar, and although he did not at any
time lean toward the philanthrop stuff hard
enough to push it over, still he felt that he’d
like to do a few Good Things for the Community
before he hopped the Styx.</p>

<p>In his mental unfoldment he had forged clear
past the point where One feels that One has
done One’s full duty when One takes care of
One’s own wife and One’s children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt that every man owed a responsibility
to the Community in which he lived, moved and
had his Three Squares.</p>

<p>So he decided to erect a public drinking fountain
with a lion spitting fresh water from
between its teeth.</p>

<p>He went and got some good news prints of
himself, then called in the reporters and
announced his decision. The announcement
was followed by a shower of publicity in the
local Press that would have cost Father John
a hundred dollars.</p>

<p>One newspaper that gave him only a Stick
and didn’t print his picture, was forthwith put
upon the Drab List and the Standing Ad of his
Business was withdrawn for life.</p>

<p>When the fountain was all set up, Our Hero
declined to pay the bill until the name of the
donor was carved in large letters in some conspicuous
place, according to the Conditions of
Agreement. So the Town Council met and
decided to carve it on the southern view of the
lion.</p>

<p>The minister of the Church which comrade
Hero attended heard of his munificent gift to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the Town. His Reverence got in some fast legwork
and ran down the modest philanthropist
just as the aforesaid latter was ducking into
his office.</p>

<p>The following Sunday morning when the
congregation assembled for a quiet snooze, the
Minister got up in the turret and announced the
recent donation of a beautiful stained-glass
window.</p>

<p>In due time the window was puttied in, showing
a patriarch with a staff and a cloven hat.
But when Old Sol turned on his spotlight, did
it reveal the graceful and modest inscription,
“Donated by A Friend?” It did—NOT. It
revealed the full and complete name of the
generous benefactor in letters about the size of
a small barn. The price he paid for the complete
job was left off, however.</p>

<p>Sometime afterwards the Town got the community
development bug. Our Hero stood up
on a vinegar barrel at a mass meeting and told
the assembled whiskers that there was no reason
on the face of God’s Green Earth why they
shouldn’t be as big as New York, and that if
every man would Put his Shoulder to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Wheel they could make Chicago look like a way-station.</p>

<p>When the cheers died down, Our Hero was
made Chairman of the Might and Main Committee.
He took off his Prince Al and got on the
job.</p>

<p>For six months he worked like a Zulu wharf-boy,
and through his Untiring Efforts the town
copped several new industries, and was lifted
from the 34th to the 24th city of the State in
point of population and municipal purity.</p>

<p>New York did not exactly get jealous and call
for a re-canvass of the Census, but there was
no question about the enhanced Well Being of
the community as a result of Our Hero’s unselfish
public spirit.</p>

<p>When the next mayoralty election came
around, one of the lesser members of the Might
and Main Committee, who had attended but one
meeting and slept throughout, put himself up
as a Candidate and offered the Committee’s
record of achievement as the reason why all
Patriotic Citizens should toss their votes in his
tub.</p>

<p>Doc Hero tried to cut in and tell the excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Populace who it was that did the Real Work of
the Might and Main Committee but he could
not break through the line. The candidate was
elected by an “overwhelming majority,” to coin
a phrase.</p>

<p>Whereupon Uncle Hero sat him down and
quilled a Public Letter to Ye Editor in which he
Regretted Deeply that his work was not
Appreciated and that he got no Credit for all
he had done for the Town.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>ON A hell-hot Saturday afternoon in
August a certain American manufacturer
sat in his executive oven mopping
like a German chef.</p>

<p>The Cashier came in and spread before him
the weekly Worry Sheet, and then chugged off
for the week-end in his little threshing machine.</p>

<p>All the other Help had of course already
gone, for it was about ten minutes before closing
time.</p>

<p>The only man left around the Works was the
afore-specified manufacturer. He couldn’t get
off because he was the Boss.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without warning, prologue, or
advance copy for the Press, he launched a
vicious right-arm jab at two million flies that
were mobilizing on his occiput, and then lammed
out the following trenchant blank verse:</p>

<p>“Blankety blank my hide if I ain’t getting
hankety-pankety sick of this blank country and
its laws. Here I am, week in and week out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
sweating like a Somali dock-hand to make both
ends meet, and instead of being charted up as
a useful, constructive factor in the country’s
development, I’m hooted from the house-tops,
shot at from ambush, chased up trees, and
hounded like a pole-cat.</p>

<p>“The goods I make are clean, legitimate,
honorable goods, and a public necessity. By
their manufacture and sale, thousands of people
have it soft on both the productive and distributive
ends of the line. If it were not for
this business, this two-spot town would be fanning
for air inside twenty-four hours, and hundreds
of happy homes would be hurdling to
Hades.</p>

<p>“Not a week goes by that I’m not digging
up for some Church, School, Library, Fair,
Famine, Hospital or some form of wallet-puller.
I pay more town, county, state and federal taxes
than the whole loafing lot of Timber Tops at
Washington put together.</p>

<p>“And yet every move I make, or don’t make,
I’m yanked up before some inch-browed
Investigating Committee to explain why I
didn’t do what I did, or did do what I didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“First they fan me for maintaining prices
and then for cutting prices. They lower freight
rates so I can compete in a certain market, and
then just when I’ve gone to the expense of
advertising and traveling it, the State and
Interstate Commissions get into a dog-fight and
they shoot the freight rates up again.</p>

<p>“They charge me an Income Tax on what I
make, and an Income Tax on what I lose. They
compel me to fill out long, winding webbed-up
Forms that they don’t understand themselves,
and that would be sufficient to dam any Office
Boy in the land for business incompetence.</p>

<p>“Out of the taxes that I and my impotent
kind are soaked with, they send a lot of clerks
over the globe to write high-school tracts on
the Old Stuff about our Great Trade Chances
Abroad, and then spring a Seaman’s Law joker
that tosses American Shipping into the Discard
and puts our goods at the mercy of ships of
Nations that are out to stick tacks in the tire of
American Trade.</p>

<p>“For twenty years sane men have been
struggling to pull the Tariff out of the toils of
Party Pilferers and give Industry a chance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
tell where it’s at, and yet to this muggy day it
is made the mule on which Boneheads in black
fedoras ride in and out of Congress.</p>

<p>“I maintain that the backbone, brains and
belly of this Nation is BUSINESS, and yet
when it comes to enacting legislation, Business
hasn’t the voice of a pink-eyed chigger. It
is forced to operate under laws made by men
that couldn’t hold a bill clerk’s job in a
Brooklyn kiosk, and I for one am getting good
and dam sick of the whole frowsy, fiddling
farce.”</p>

<p>With this perorational explosion, Comrade
Manufacturer slapped down the corrugated
cover of his Roll Top, jammed his hat on a bent
ear, and soled off home to take it out on The
Folks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Monday morning came around, according to
cosmic custom. The much admired face of the
office clock smiled out the hour of ten, and the
last story of the week-end’s mush had been
passed along Bookkeeper’s Row.</p>

<p>A neatly harnessed young man with a well-groomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
superstructure appeared at the
General Office Door.</p>

<p>“What is the nature of your business?”
inquired the Office Rat in a ripsaw crescendo.</p>

<p>“Tell him I am a Field Secretary of the
National Business Men’s Phalanx, lately organized
to express the collective business
sentiment of the Nation to the law-builders at
Washington,” replied the Field Secretary.
“And tell him,” he added, handing out his
official pasteboard, “that I am here to explain
to him why he should become a member.”</p>

<p>The boy bowlegged off to an adjoining office
and returned with the pleasing tidings that the
Boss was Too Busy.</p>

<p>“Go back and tell him that it is to <i>his</i> interest
that I be allowed to come alongside now,” said
Field Secretary.</p>

<p>The boy reluctantly went away again, and
in a moment later came back and told the F. S.
to take a seat. Whereupon the F. S. took
it, and then for one long, lonely newspaper-reading,
thumb-twirling, watch-glancing hour
he held it down without a whimper.</p>

<p>Finally he called the boy again and told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that he’d like to see the Boss during
the present era if possible. The boy waddled
off once more to the secret chamber of the Great
and Grouchy One. When he returned he
brought back this cheery message:</p>

<p>“Tell the gentleman I don’t believe I care to
go into the matter. I am Very Busy today, and
besides, I am not in favor of these Associations
that cost a lot of money and produce no
results.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied the Field Secretary
sweetly, “I’ll consider myself null and void.”</p>

<p>“But just kindly inform your intelligent
Boss for me,” he continued, “that the reason
these Associations cost a lot of money is because
of the time they lose in hanging around waiting
to get possum heads like himself to see their
own Game. And the reason they ‘produce no
results’ is because stupid men can’t see that
they’ve got to get together to produce results.”</p>

<p>“And tell him further,” went on Field Sec.,
edging toward the door and raising his voice
just high enough so that it could be heard about
seven miles, “that while I shall expect to lose
my good hundred-dollar job for it, I can not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
restrain myself the pleasure of telling him and
his visionless ilk that they deserve just exactly
the kind of legislation they are getting, and that
as far as I myself am concerned, they can all
go and take a great big jump into the seventeenth
sub-basement of hell. Good-NIGHT!”</p>

<p>And with this impressive Valedictory the
Field Secretary departed, slamming the door so
hard that it jarred the ledger out of balance
and woke up every clerk in the place.</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 5<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Advertising Genius of Squirrelville</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a><br /><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was a Hotel Clerk in a one-ply
town who yearned to become an Ad Man.</p>

<p>He could have yearned to become
President of the United States if he had wanted
to, but there wasn’t so much money in the
president business.</p>

<p>His name was Fred, but they called him
Chesterton for short.</p>

<p>During his incarceration as Glad Hander at
the McGlook House, Chesterton had lived to see
one of the Town Terriers go down to New York
and hoof up great clods of turf in the arena of
Successful Advertising.</p>

<p>This fired his Ambition, and when later he
learned that the reporter on the Squirrelville
Banner had just landed a good job as Advertising
Manager for a nearby manufactory which
had begun to stretch, he just up and heard the
voice of Destiny calling him through a railway
megaphone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it was, one Gladsome spring morning,
that Chesterton backed away from the little pine
hotel-desk for good, and plunged eye-deep into
the intricacies of the Advertising Art.</p>

<p>Chesterton’s first clever move was to procure
copies of The Banner and analyze all the local
Advertisements, but after close scrutiny he
concluded that they all leaned heavily to The
Rotten.</p>

<p>Which they did.</p>

<p>Which they did beyond the slightest shadow
of a little round doubt.</p>

<p>The Liveryman’s Advertisement, for instance,
didn’t “Tell The Story,” reflected
Chesterton who had already begun to show an
easy familiarity with Publicity Terms. And
he observed also that the reminder which stood
all the year around in the daily 3 in. dbl. col.
Display of the Elite Stationary &amp; Supply Store
to the effect that Prospective Patrons should
do their Christmas shoplifting early, did not
appear to be timely copy for July.</p>

<p>Let not the thought here sneak into your
mind, Gentile Reader, that our embryonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
George Creel confined his observations solely
to advertisements committed by local craftsmen.
On the contrary he went to the Eureka
News Shop and procured copies of all the
national magazines and periodicals that carried
advertising to enliven the reading matter, and
every Ad in them came under the sweep of his
cold unemotional eye.</p>

<p>“One common fault I find in all of them,”
mused Chesterton. “They all lack The Punch.”</p>

<p>Which criticism should be sufficient to prove
to The Reader that Chestie old toppo was now
a full-feathered Ad Writer. In the bright lexicon
of Publicity there is no word that mouthes
so smoothly. When in doubt, talk about The
Punch!</p>

<p>To make a long story about seven pages
shorter, we will now brush the dandruff off
our coat-collar and say that Chesterton accidentally
ran across the Three Ball Column of
one of the magazines where the Frayed Boys
of the Advertising World are accustomed to
hanging up their best belongings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The first one that caught his eye was this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

“PULLEM PETE—The powerful penster
who pulls peppy potent phrases for particular
patrons—try him—6c for a sample
slasher, or 50 individual humdinging
follow-ups for 40c.”</div>

<p>Following this sizzling specimen of alliterative
skill, Chesterton ran across this one:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

“AD MAN ARONSON penned one pep and
paprika sales letter that pulled $80,000,000
worth of business. He can do the same for
you. Specimen letter, 11 cents and postage.
Lock box 4-11-44, Spinach Corners, Conn.”</div>

<p>By this time Chesterton was all het up for
he saw where all these Sales Letter Builders
were making their big mistake and he felt the
feathers of his guardian angel’s wing tickling
his spine all the way up.</p>

<p>Intuitively he knew that his footsteps had
been guided at last to the big bronze door of
Opportunity, and that all he had to do was to
knock on her and she would be opened up Unto
him. He was politician-sure that he had the
password. And the password was PRICE!</p>

<p>And so Chestie sat him down at his little
school-desk in the attic, which he had fixed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
neatly as his office with a newsprint of St. Elmo
as his patron saint, and after three non-union
days’ labor he carved out this modest little
synopsis of his advertisorial equipment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
I AM CHESTERTON OF SQUIRRELVILLE—I
write serial follow-ups that tear
the teeth out of indifference, pull the wool
off the sky-piece of scepticism, rouse interest
to a frenzy and send the prospect
screaming down the aisle to pay tithe to the
titillating tin box. A sample letter will cost
you $100.00. Three letters for $200.00.
Cash with order regardless of rating. Business
already booked makes delivery of copy
impossible to guarantee under seven months
after order is placed.</div>

<p>Looking the copy over once more, Chesterton
decided that there was only one thing the matter
with it. The price was too much to the
Clothing Sale. So he raised it another $100.00
and then fired the copy off to a couple of good
advertising media.</p>

<p>Then he lit up a piece of tampa twine and
walked out in the backyard and put chicken-wire
around all the trees so the goats would not
bark them when the stampede commenced.</p>

<p>One week later the Postman was rolling up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Chesterton’s mail in barrels. One year later,
all Squirrelville was working in various departments
of the Chesterton Advertising Agency.</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 6<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Salesman Who Became Buyer</span></small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>BILL was a Salesman with a series of chins,
who chewed the ends of his cigars and
was by nature Very Sociable.</p>

<p>The bell sprints would all stampede for his
Leathers when he arrived at a/an hotel, and the
Clerk always had some little confidential pleasantry
to whisper into his large jovial ear when
handing him his Room Key.</p>

<p>Bill abhorred all forms of convention, had
no use for vests, and never called any man
“Mr.” past the introduction, no matter how
high the social or financial pinnacle from which
the party breathed his ozone. In the course
of a twenty-minute conversation a Mr. John
Wanamaker would become plain “Wanamaker,”
then “John” and finally “Jack,”
whether Jack liked it or not.</p>

<p>Truthfully speaking, it cannot be said that
Bill’s particular brew of bon-hominy made as
big a hit with the average Buyer as it did, for
example, with the drayman who juggled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
trunks up to the Hotel. As a matter of bald
clean-shaven fact, most of the Larger Buyers
in Bill’s territory threw up a redoubt of icy
Reserve every time he wheezed in to see them;
and, to anyone of Bill’s Genial and Sunny Nature,
such an aggressive exhibition of unsociabiliousness
is sure to prove a thorn in the
flank.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Bill in time made no dark
secret of his Real Opinion of any man who
thought he had to starch all up like a Bank
President just because a pull with the Powers
had made him a Buyer instead of a Bill Clerk.</p>

<p>He didn’t see, he contended, why a Salesman
representing a Concern that covered forty acres
Under Roof and made all their own castings,
was not just as good as the man he was trying
to sell.</p>

<p>So far as Bill was concerned, he was getting
foddered up to the gills, he said, trying to be
friendly with certain deaf and dumb Yappoos
that sit twirling paper-knives and eyeing a
Salesman with the critical eye of an alienist
just because he is doing his damdest to cheer
them up and make them act Natural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The wise Buyer, argued Bill, is the man who
treats Salesmen like pals, because he can get
more out of them that way; and moreover, Salesmen
are always in position to do the Buyer a
Good Turn in the Trade, as well as up at the
Factory when the Complaints come in.</p>

<p>Now it was the custom of Bill’s firm to use
some of their Salesmen in the home office when
the men came in off the road between seasons.
It was a good custom because it not only enabled
the Salesmen to earn a portion of their
salaries during the dull months, but also got
them into the habit of breakfasting before Noon.</p>

<p>Bill became particularly adept at this Indoor
Exercise especially in the Purchasing Department
where he helped at odd jobs, besides helping
himself to cigars that were daily presented
to the Purchasing Agent in the sacred cause of
bribery.</p>

<p>It was soon discovered that Bill had a keen
and steady eye when it came to judging materials
and prices, and the Purchasing Agent got
sort of in the habit of mistrusting his own
flickering wick and turning over a good deal
of his work to Bill, especially when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Very Busy, such as selecting from a mail-order
catalogue some kind of a suitable cap to wear
on his forthcoming fishing trip.</p>

<p>One day, as Luck would have it, Comrade
Purchasing Agent suddenly up and kicked off
his mortal cocoon, leaving behind him a wife
and a gallon of gasoline for his motorcycle. Bill
was chosen to fill the vacant chair, and putting
it Very Mildly yet informingly, the news did not
exactly crush him to death. On the contrary,
he went out in the Coat Room and shook hands
with himself until he had two lead arms and
one limp theologian’s grip left in his Gripper.</p>

<p>Bill’s first week as Buyer saw him billy-sundaying
every salesmanic trail-hitter that
struck the Works. But somehow the Open Arm
stuff seemed to convey to visiting Salesmen the
impression that Bill as Buyer for the Works
intended to lay in a million dollars’ worth of
their Stuff. When he told them that he wasn’t
in the market, they couldn’t seem to assimilate
the tidings and just continued to hang on until
the whistle blew and the regular daily imitation
of the Rush from Pompeii commenced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Bill’s second week as Buyer saw him giving
Explicit Instructions to the Office Spaniel to
bring to him the card of every visiting Salesman
before letting the gunk in. In this way quite
a few zeppelins were put out of commission
before they reached the First Line Trench, and
Bill got several minutes each day in which to
Attend to Business.</p>

<p>But Bill’s heart was still too full of the mush-and-milk
of Human Kindness to long hold down
the lid on his Buoyant and Bubbling nature, and
so he continued to spend most of his conscious
hours watching the skilful Air Navigators loop-the-loop
from dizzy heights. Besides, there
was in Bill himself a lingering love for the
sport which he found it hard to curb, and which
caused him to forget his position as Buyer every
once in a while and ascend as high as any of
The Boys—though always to regret it when
he came to earth again.</p>

<p>Bill’s third week as Buyer found him with his
Office moved back a mile and a half from the
front door and all approaches barb-wired and
mined. Out in the Reception Office hung a sign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
“Salesmen seen Thursdays ONLY, between
10:30 and 11:30,” and while the lettering was
not large enough to be seen across the river, it
was plainly visible to everything this side.</p>

<p>Such Salesmen as were fortunate enough to
receive an invitation to visit Bill’s imperial
headquarters were escorted by two gendarmes
with secret Road Maps that enabled them to
find the way; and these Luckies were then permitted
to stand unheeded in the doorway from
20 to 30 minutes twirling their little dollar derbys
and snapping the rubber-band on their
leather covered catalogues until such time as
the Honorable Bill had finished dictating his
daily batch of Third Reader essays.</p>

<p>The idea in keeping these few privileged
Samsons of The Sale hovering around the entrance
to the refrigerator was to give them time
to apply the Air Compressor after observing
certain ominous signs which Bill had hung
around the walls and which read: “Be brief,”
“Tell it, and Tell it Quick,” “Come to the point.
If there isn’t any STAY OUT!”</p>

<p>If the visitors were not thoroughly cowed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
these sinister signals, they could proceed further
and read an additional warning painted on
the back of the Visitor’s Chair which read:
“This is no Park Bench.” The letters were
about the size of the name on the side of a
Neutral Merchantman.</p>

<p>Whenever Bill said to a waiting Salesman,
“Come in,” you could see his breath like on a
crisp winter morn. After that, he wouldn’t say
another word until the Salesman had finished
a five-minute Oration. Then Bill would say,
“Not interested. Good day.”</p>

<p>Under this policy of Frightfulness, Bill naturally
became the target for a shower of shrapnel
every time The Boys got together in the
Smoker. What one would forget to call Bill,
another would think of, thus thoroughly canvassing
the Field of Invective at every session.</p>

<p>One fine day an Old Customer to whom Bill
had once sold goods when he himself was a
livery-bumping County Hopper, blew into the
Office as the Representative of an Advertising
Novelty House. It seems that Business had
gone bunc with the Old Customer and he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
been obliged to knit up with a Road Job to keep
the wolf off the door-mat. He was sure he could
land his old friend Bill as a new customer for
his almanacs or some other neat and fetching
advertising novelty, and thus make a Killing
with his Firm. He sent word back to the barracks
where Bill was entrenched saying that
he was waiting in the offing and wanted to see
him. Bill frowned when he saw the card but
told the sentry to show him in anyway.</p>

<p>A few moments later the poor misguided Yob,
who had read his Human Nature all awry, appeared
at the door of the Cold Storage Plant,
and, catching sight of Bill who sat stalling as
usual and didn’t see the Approach, rushed into
the room with an extended bronze paw the size
of a Smithfield ham and yelled: “Hello Bill
old socks!”</p>

<p>The shock was too much. To have been
“Billed” by this brazen intruder would have
been bad enough, but to be “Socked” at the
same time was the belt-below-the-belt that laid
Bill low. With one hand clapped to his heart
and the other to his head, he staggered to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
feet and then fell heavily to the ice-bound floor—a
victim of heart failure superinduced by
acute inflammation of the Ego.</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 7<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Pampered Dealer</span></small></h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a><br /><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>



<p class='drop-cap'>A &nbsp; CERTAIN condescending old zambuck
thought he was doing his Town a large
comprehensive favor by being in the
hardware business.</p>

<p>Whenever a Customer entered his store,
carrying the door-webs through on his hat, the
grouchy one would look over his glasses to see
who it was, and then go on reading his newspaper
until he got good and ready, thereby
justly rebuking the intruder.</p>

<p>Salesmen who called to sell him their flawless
Goods used to grow old and hoary sitting
around the dumpo waiting for him to say officially
that he didn’t care to look at the stuff.</p>

<p>Then they would salaam low and in a galley-grind’s
voice thank him for the interview, and
back out of the place on their shirt-fronts, and
go sell a lot of Small Bills at high prices over
the County at the expense of Dear House, and
then come back and beg the Civic Benefactor
to accept the bouquet at 50 percent profit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
himself by placing an order covering only the
bare quantity they had sold for him.</p>

<p>With a show of reluctance and drab boredom
seldom seen outside the Banking Business,
the old Nawab would finally put his influential
signature to the Order, but only on condition
that the manufacturers consented to run an
Advertisement at their own cost in the local
paper featuring his progressive and popular
Establishment. Of course if they cared at the
same time to slide in a few 5-point words about
their own goods, why he would have no special
objection.</p>

<p>If it so happened occasionally that he so far
lost his balance as to buy one dollar and sixty
cents’ worth more stuff than had already been
sold for him by the visiting Salesman, he would
sit himself down on his comfortable chair-pad
of old newspapers and write off a starchy hand-tooled
letter to the House—on stationery that
had been printed for him free of charge by some
Easy Eugene of the manufacturing world—and
insist emphatically upon having a Special
Man from the factory payroll to help him dispose
of the surplus as well as wait upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
customers, assist in taking Inventory, and be
generally useful about the premises.</p>

<p>It is not recorded that any of the manufacturers
who were privileged to sell their goods
to this highly respected and pampered posh
went so far as to pay his store rent for him
or defray the expenses of his family wash.</p>

<p>But through their tripe-eyed vision of Sales
Promotion they ultimately succeeded in swelling
his super-structure to the point where he
was able to snuggle down into the comforting
hallucination that he could throw any one of
them into the bogs of bankruptcy at any time by
simply holding back his thirty-cent orders.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that a certain young
Lochinvar of high voltage had been tiptoeing
about for a favorable Town in which to weigh-in
a blooded Hardware Store, and he happened
to hear of this martyr to the noble cause of
service.</p>

<p>In fact every Salesman that Young Loch met
told him the same story about the old crabbino,
but some of them heralded the tidings with less
profanity than did others.</p>

<p>Young Loch did not have to get a powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
field-glass to see the Opportunity that lay before
him and stretched out its arms. He could see
it with his eyes tied behind his back.</p>

<p>So forthwith he sallied to the Particular Town
to which we have up and alluded, and in due
season he opened him up an establishment that
had old Puffed Bean’s place looking like a
Hongkong junk hole. The swellest cry in
Hardware Shelving was installed, and you
could close your big searching eyes and walk
all over the place without tangling up with nail
kegs, rope, barbed wire and other embellishments
peculiar to the small-town hardware
dispensary.</p>

<p>When the erstwhile Dictator first got news of
the coming invasion, the crust began to crack
slightly around the edges of his aloofness. He
commenced saying Good Morning to his Customers
and introduced other revolutionary
changes in the business.</p>

<p>Also he began a quiet but systematic campaign
of subterranean rapping against Young
Loch, having scratched up the buried fact that
Loch’s grandfather had once swiveled the
books when he was County Treasurer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>But Loch was so busy connecting up with
desirable Agencies that he paid about as much
attention to the Opposition as if it had been
located in Portuguese West Africa.</p>

<p>One by one those manufacturers who had
been supplying their exceptional wares in driblets
to old Punko, decided to give Young Loch
exclusive control for the following sound and
sufficient reasons, to-wit and as follows: first,
because he was willing to place a decent-sized
order on Regular Terms with no overhanging
strain in way of Special Conditions; and second,
because of the reason just stated.</p>

<p>Loch also ran 6-inch dbl. cols. at regular rates
in the influential Local Sheet advertising the
Lines he carried and received many free cols.
in the restricted Reading Pages where he was
heralded as a young man of Exceptional
Promise, and his project as a Valuable Addition
to the Large And Growing Commerce of Our
Town.</p>

<p>Young Loch did not ask the manufacturers
to contribute anything toward this smashing
publicity campaign, except Electros of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
thrice-inspected Goods, which they promptly
forgot to send, according to custom.</p>

<p>When old Maharaja Magoop saw his Customers
dropping off like crumbs when the table-cloth
is snapped, he began to get very irritabilious
and petulant, and told the Town Folks
in a wavering falsetto what he thought of the
civic spirit of a community that would desert
a Lifelong Taxpayer for some young Upstart
who had never helped the Town in any way.</p>

<p>Several people, who could not conveniently
pay their accounts at the time because they had
told the Ice Man to bring ice every day, were
inclined to agree with him right up to the doggone
roof; but even these few anti-penults were
obliged to patronize Young Loch’s place to a
certain extent because The Latter now had the
exclusive agency for certain leading Implement
Lines formerly held down by The Former, and
which required Repair Parts that must fit perfectly,
but usually didn’t.</p>

<p>At last it was brought home to the once
Mighty Monarch that any Dealer who controlled
a well-advertised and popular Line of Goods
enjoyed a Valuable Asset and was supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
move a muscle once in a while in the direction
of selling the stuff, and not expect the manufacturer
of it to do all the chores.</p>

<p>Into his concrete cone was also drilled the
tardy knowledge that a Customer is entitled to
some slight measure of Service, and in the sanctified
name of Profit should not be regarded in
the light of a blaspheming intruder if he fails
to wiggle in on an abject stomach and apologize
for leaving some of his money in the joint.</p>

<p>In short, old Rigid Neck came to see ultimately
that he was in the Discard good and fine.
With ever-increasing grouchiness he gradually
jelled down in the old sagged Cane Seat where
the merry little spiders could spin their silvery
webs in peace above his cosmos.</p>

<p>The last heard of him, he had rented out his
Store window to an itinerant printer who installed
therein a nice little Foot Press and was
doing very neat calling-cards for 50c per 100.</p>

<p>As for Young Loch he kept up the Good Work
full many a year and came to be most highly
respected by his Fellow Citizens, including the
President of the Enterprise Real Estate &amp;
Investment Company whose budding daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Loch plucked off the rosebush of Love before
his red-eared rivals got within a mile of the
garden.</p>

<p>Loch was also beloved by Salesmen everywhere,
for he never asked them for an Inside
Five, a breakage allowance, or donation of
Goods for a Church Fair Raffle.</p>

<p>And he always got through with The Boys
in time for them to get away on the Four Forty-Five
and see a good Show in the Big Town that
night.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was a Piece of Cheese.</p>

<p>He wore a stand-up collar, broken-lot
size, and had a/an Adam’s Apple that
used to romp up and down the highway every
time he swallowed.</p>

<p>Also he was the busiest bee in the swarm.</p>

<p>After supper each night he had to rush down
to the Depot to see that the Railway Boys escorted
the 7:12 in and out of the Town all
right, and then he’d rush back to the Cigar
Store to hear the phonograph play, and lay
down a few sound rules on International Relations
until the President of the First National
Bank came in to buy his after-dinner cigar
and it was time to lock up.</p>

<p>After that, he would tear madly over to the
Kelly House and there drop a few pearls of
wisdom before the Night Clerk while that dignitary
was out at the curb cleaning the big tin
cuspidors that had served in their day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
emphasize many a heated argument between
rival groups of local parliamentarians.</p>

<p>Ed Galloway was the name of our genius-in-the-cocoon
and wherever Ed was to be found,
you knew that something of importance was
pending. He seemed to have a gift for being
on the spot. If you saw him streaking up Mill
Street, you might wonder where he was going,
and he might wonder where he was going, but
before he got a block away, a barn or something
would be sure to catch fire just as he
was passing it, or a horse get his hoof caught
in the trace, or somebody would be driving a
stake just a wee bit off center, and straightaway
Ed Galloway would find an avenue for his services
or advice. He was present everywhere
but Church.</p>

<p>Of course there were certain narrow, quibbling
spirits, just as there are in every hamletto,
who objected to Ed always chiseling in on everything,
but there were not lacking those who,
like Jeff Webster, Sole Owner and Proprietor
of Webster’s Bus Line, believed that Ed Galloway
had pretty near the right hashish on things,
nine times out of ten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Away off somewhere in Thibet or in Sumatra
there may have been some petty local question
that Ed was not wisdomed-up on, but everything
that took on the character of a national
or international issue, he could discuss from
basement to belfry. He was as much at home
in the busy arena of Politics and Business as he
was in the wide realm of Science and Philosophy.</p>

<p>There was one thing that Ed had in common
with all great political leaders, whether they
were fully aware of it or not. It was a positive,
ultimatum-like tone in which he rendered his
decisions in all cases, regardless of their importance
to you, to him and/or to the world at large.</p>

<p>If, for instance, Ed happened to pass a cup
of water from the Court House pump to the
stranger within the gates, he would say: “That
water, Sir, is the purest, freshest water in this
here whole State.” He’d say it with a sweep
of the arm that seemed to include not only the
State but the whole Universe, neither of which
territories had he ever canvassed.</p>

<p>And invariably the stranger, after drinking
the ordinary every-day water from the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
every-day Court House pump, would smack his
lips and agree with Ed and have another go
at it.</p>

<p>Now everybody in every town of every State
of every Nation says the same thing about the
water of his particular pump, and there is nothing
of news-value either in this observation on
our part, or in the statement re pure water on
the part of said kanoops the world over.</p>

<p>But whenever Ed Galloway up and said that
water was pure, or the Tariff was doomed, or
that Stocks would go to a New Low, or that we
were going to have rain, you had a sense that
here was a man who undoubtedly had a corner
on all outstanding knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p>Ed’s words always carried a certain vanadium
finality that clinched the case and demoralized
rebuttal, but there was always left in
the heart of the Vanquished a sort of half-formed
desire to call Ed a liar on general principles,
although with no hopes of course of
proving it; for Ed was always there with The
Figures, which he dug up out of the vasty deep
of his Imagination to support his side of the
case, while his opponent usually was equipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with nothing but a village vocab of short jerky
monosyllables and a chew of tobacco.</p>

<p>One day Ed met the owner of the Plow Factory
in the barber’s chair getting his chinchillas
chipped and told him right off the keyboard
that his plant was doing but 8-3/4 percent of the
total plow business of the county.</p>

<p>The old wowser gasped like a gaffed sturgeon
at this impertinent news and attempted to swing
back more or less crushingly, but the lather got
in his mixer, and so all he could do was to lie
there and let Ed go ahead and throw the short-horn.</p>

<p>Ed proceeded to tell him exactly how many
farms there were in the County, State and Nation,
the acreage under cultivation, the average
number of plows per farm, and so on.</p>

<p>And then Ed wheeled suddenly about, and
pointing his finger accusingly at his be-lathered
and outstretched victim, exclaimed: “How
many of these four thousand three hundred and
thirty-two plows did YOU sell in Crooked Creek
County last year!”</p>

<p>The old man did not say so, but he as much
as admitted that he was a dub at the facts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his own business, and later on when he was
putting on his overcoat, and Jake the star
wielder of the rasp was helping to pull his undercoat
down where it didn’t belong, he turned
around pseudo-casually to Ed and told him to
drop around to the factory some afternoon and
have a chat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now it so happened that the Young Man who
had charge of the Sales and Advertising end of
the Plow Factory was a very faithful and steady
Young Man. His conduct was at all times “exemplary,”
to coin a word.</p>

<p>Every morning as the Court House clock
struck eight, he could be seen dismounting from
his tin bicycle at exactly the same spot in front
of the office door. He had never been late but
one morning in his episcopalean life, and that
was after a thick night at the Welfare Social
when he went in too strong for the strawberry-whisp.</p>

<p>He was one of those Young Men you can always
Rely Upon. You know the kind—always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the same. He did the same thing this year that
he did last year: (a) and at the same time:
(b) and in the same place: (c) and in the same
way.</p>

<p>The same Copy that stood in the Ads last
year, stood in the Ads this year—and occasionally
got tired and sat down in the valuable
space.</p>

<p>All his letters to The Trade opened and closed
the same way like a door—“Replying to
yours” and “Hoping to have.”</p>

<p>He also wrote Weekly Letters to the Men on
the Road and talked in the earnest, measured
phrases of a requiem, about Punch and Pep and
Live Wire. There was almost enough live wire
in these salesmanic scintillations to singe the
hair off an apple. After you got past the waxed
opener beginning with the inevitable “Well
Boys,” the stuff went like a warm home-brew.</p>

<p>There was another thing about this Young
Man worthy of eulogy. He was one of those
Model Employees who always pitch the ball so
the Boss can hit it. Whenever the Old Man
would ask him a question he would burst a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
blood-vessel straining to answer it so that it
would stack four-square with what the O. M.
thought about the matter.</p>

<p>To sum up, this young Sales and Advertising
Manager of the hitherto tabulated Plow Factory,
was, confidentially speaking, habitually
scared to a pea-green that he would offend the
Boss and lose his good hundred-dollar job.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That is why he never told Dear Boss about
a/an Idea he had perfected for increasing Sales,
and never dared slip it into operation on his own
account either.</p>

<p>But that night when Ed Galloway met him
coming from the Revival and began to ask him
all kinds of questions about the factory and the
plow business in general, so as to shape himself
up strong for his coming interview with the
Big Flash, the Young Man unsuspectingly
opened up and told Ed all the things he could
do for the Works if he were only given half
a chance.</p>

<p>The next day Ed, primed like a new pump,
blew out to the Factory. When he asked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
see the Boss, all the little time-clock punchers
in the place began to twitter and twutter. They
knew Ed of old and logically concluded he was
booking himself for a thorny turn-down. But
he wasn’t.</p>

<p>The Boss told Ed to come right in and take
a chair. Ed took it and brought it as close
to the Boss’s desk as he could without rubbing
it against the Old Man’s chest. Then he sat
down on it and said he only had a couple of
minutes to spare but would like to lay down
briefly a plan he had worked out for building
Sales.</p>

<p>And with that business-like prelim, Ed proceeded
to put into concrete and fearless expression
the very Idea that the Model Young Man
had confided to him the night before.</p>

<p>The Old Man scowled pleasingly,—a token
of endorsement, which, had it been directed to
any regular inmate of the place, from the Manager
down to the Office Roach, would have emboldened
the Trusty to ask for a salary lift.
But Ed Galloway preferred to ignore the democratic
outburst and continued right on, just as
if the Boss had told him to get out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>He adjusted his adams-apple, threw an effective
knit-brow, and said that what We must first
do was to find out Our strength in the Trade.</p>

<p>“The way to go about it,” he said, “is to
first send out a return post-card to every farmer
in Crooked Creek County asking him how he
likes his Arrow Plow. Farmers are irish-loyal
to any farm tool they like—see? They won’t
exactly genuflect to it, but they’ll yell and wave
and that sort of thing—see? And they love
nothing better than to write letters to Firms.</p>

<p>“All right, then: if they are already using
an Arrow Plow, they’ll say so all over the return
post-card and up the margins. And if
they’re using some other make of plow—see?—they’ll
be just as proud to tell what plow it
is. Get it?”</p>

<p>“Now then,” continued Ed, grabbing a pencil
and commencing to figure on the Old Man’s
shirt front, “the returns will be 90 percent easy—and
from these returns we can get the
Arrow’s actual strength as well as the strength
of the Competition in the terry-tory, thus
enabling us to focus first on the weak spots and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
then throw our whole force against our competitors’
strong-hold. Get me?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now there is no sane reason why this little
tale should be dragged out to the length of a
Turn Verein entertainment, and so we are not
going on to tell you how the Boss got all het
up over this and other plans that Ed Galloway
got from the Model Young Lobster and then
presented to The Boss, nor how Doc Boss
finally gave Ed <i>carte blanche</i> and things like
that, and told him to go ahead and put the
various campaigns through.</p>

<p>Nor are we going to mention the coincidental
visit to the Plow Factory of an Advertising
man from one of the big national agencies—a
dashing, dynamic, daredevil, who would dare
anything on somebody else’s money—and who
mapped out for Ed Galloway an original and
corking national campaign which Ed promptly
submitted to The Boss as the child of his own
brilliant brain, and which the Agency Man
didn’t care a dam about so long as he scythed
in his good old fifteen percent agency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
commission, and which went through with a
whoop and proved to be one big snorting, pawing,
red-nostriled, fiery success.</p>

<p>Nor are we going into a lot of yawny detail
all about how the Factory rose from its
musty Rip and became one of the greatest
farm machinery organizations in the country
and put up a mammoth electric sign so that
passengers on the Limited could see “THE
HOME OF THE ARROW PLOW,” and almost
got news of its erection on the Associated Wire
(dam the censors!) and how the Company stood
up $500,000 against Andy Carnegie’s $500 for
a Library for the Town, and got new engraved
letterheads showing a birds-eye of the whole
town as the factory with the name of Edward
Galloway as General Sales &amp; Advertising
Director.</p>

<p>All we are going to mention is that in time
Ed put off the straight-stand collar, and put on
some flesh over the adams-apple, and quit getting
his neck shaved clear around, and began
making abstract speeches, (written by
somebody else because he was so busy) on
“EFFICIENCY” before Ad-Men’s Clubs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Civic Bodies, until at last he stood Big Favorite
wherever talk is talked.</p>

<p>Today Edward Ewart Galloway, Efficiency
Engineer, sits in his own luxurious suite of solid
mahog in New York, surrounded on every side
by Brains to which he adds Guts and clears 85
percent net on the combination.</p>

<p>Every little while he gets an emergency call
from some big industrial patient who pays him
a steel magnate’s salary to come out to their
plant and sit around smoking dollar cigars and
twisting his moustache and looking wonderfully
wise until such time as he can quietly find out
what their own Sales Manager’s plans are for
the coming season, and then in a Confidential
Report to the Board, recommend them as his
own good, original, incomparable stuff.</p>

<p>And the moral of it all is this: If you would
rise in the Boss’s estimation and in salary, tell
him occasionally that he doesn’t know what
he’s talking about. It’s the only compliment
he’ll stand for.</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 9<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Road Rat Who Gave Up Home Comforts</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a><br /><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p class='drop-cap'>THE Whiffles did not exactly dwell on any
Estate sweeping the green hills. They
lived, moved and had their boiled cabbage
in one of those sedentary little dumps that
get their air through the keyhole in winter and
smell like a Subway Local on a wet day.</p>

<p>The Whiffles had a son by the name of
Ezekiel. On top of it he wore a readymade tie
with a corset-stay on the back to keep it from
looking human.</p>

<p>Ezekiel’s father had jute whiskers that blossomed
from the chin out. He used to sit in the
kitchen in his stocking-feet making nothing out
of a piece of old wire. This hasn’t anything to
do with the story, so we are tabulating it before
the action begins.</p>

<p>It was Ezekiel’s daily custom to drop in at
the Kelly House to find out if the Four Twenty
was on time and thereby live more abundantly.</p>

<p>On this particular day, while Ezekiel was
discussing the momentous issue with the diligently
idle crowd of local Chair Polishers, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
got acquainted with a Travelling Salesman
from Whopps Corners, Ind., who always registered
from New York City and wore a golden-pheasant
vest.</p>

<p>Ezekiel had been reading about the Opportunities
that were standing around on the corners
of every big city getting bowlegged waiting for
competent men to come and get them. So he
asked the New York Salesman from Whopps
Corners how about it.</p>

<p>The Salesman was modest and retiring, in
keeping with the traditions of his profession,
and it was therefore under considerable reluctance
that he admitted to Ezekiel, with rather
long easy puffs of the hessian, that as for himself
he was only fetching down about a thousand
dollars a month salary, plus a reasonable
monthly unearned increment from his Expense
Account. In spite of his shyness he seemed to
give off the general impression that the Selling
Game was one rosy-cheeked cinch.</p>

<p>Ezekiel thereupon decided that of all the fine
arts, Salesmanship appeared to offer opportunities
of the most scopeful circumference for
becoming a millionaire in one reel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>So he went home and changed his socks in a
devil-may-care fashion, and started for Chicago
that same night, determined to land a job with
some big House that travelled snappy men and
did not grieve about Expense Accounts.</p>

<p>He was shrewd enough before leaving home
to re-inforce his proposition with several strong
To-Whom-It-May-Concerns from men of high
standing in the community. One was from the
Mayor of Squirrel Cove and another was executed
by the Proprietor of the Crescent Hand
Laundry who up and spoke in no uncertain tone
respecting the high esteem in which our fellow
townsman, Ezekiel Whiffle, was held by one and
all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here let it be set down truthfully, with malice
toward none, that Ezekiel Whiffle was no speckled
yobbish when it came to doing the thing he
packed off to do. He had a life-long record of
accomplishment as clean as a willow whistle
from the day he set out as a youth to shingle
the silo, down to the last leg of the last stove
he set up at the Hardware Store before his
departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it did not take Ezekiel one thousand
years to land a job in Chicago, although the
parking facilities for men less energetic were
very tempting in the City of Basement
Restaurants.</p>

<p>Within one week of his first lap round the
Loop, Ezekiel had secured a comfortable berth
as County Hurdler for a large Manufacturing
Concern that was struggling to make both ends
meet on 142 percent net profit after paying
State and Federal squeeze.</p>

<p>Ezekiel’s very earnestness impressed the
Boss, even if his Letters of Recommendation did
not cause any wild demonstration around the
Works. His lack of experience gave him a
fresh point of view. He was quite free from
the customary we-never-did-it-that-way advice
to men who had been running their own business
successfully for twenty years.</p>

<p>When the matter of salary was mentioned,
Ezekiel had to remove his ear-muffs to be sure
he heard the figure correctly. But he decided
to go to it anyway and prove that he was worth
more than the sixty dollars a month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>During the following fortnight Ezekiel overalled
it in the various departments of the big
Works getting grease on his face and gathering
a rustic headful of practical information which
resolved itself finally into a beautifully webbed
mass that made the last estate of the poor goop
worse than the first.</p>

<p>Zeekie was assigned by the Sales Manager
to Luke’s Rock, Iowa, for the initial sales bombardment.
The Sales Manager, with his well-set
little New England head, had of course
never been there himself, just as he had never
been any place else, but he talked as though he
had been making the dorp for years, and assured
Ezekiel that there were wonderful possibilities
at Luke’s Rock and said he would be
greviously disappointed if Zeke did not pull
out of there with fourteen carloads scored up
in his Order Book.</p>

<p>“We are expecting big things of you,” he
said.</p>

<p>“That’s more than I am expecting of you,”
replied Zeke. But he replied it strictly to himself.</p>

<p>Then the S. M. gave Zeke one of those Boston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
handshakes and a modest bunch of Expense
Money and told him to track.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us now be seated while we study Human
Nature a little, and see if it is not a fact that
when you hand a good Job and a bunch of
Expense Money to a beadle who has never had
either, you are liable to put a crimp in his
psychology and enlarge his ego until he can’t
find anything to fit it.</p>

<p>Take for illusample: When Ezekiel went
from the Office to the Railway Station to catch
his train, he felt so goshdanged good that he
could have punched a hole through a limousine
window for sheer ebullience of spirit.</p>

<p>But when he found that his train was late,
he went up to the ticket window and told Mr.
Vanderbilt just what he thought of the whole
ratty System. And he told it so that everybody
around the room could hear it and marvel at his
courage and knowledge of railroading. He
spoke as in behalf of an injured constituency.</p>

<p>When he boarded his train and got the hang
of things, he commanded the porter to raise a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
window here and lower a shade there, and he
ignored the cuspidor entirely every time he took
a chew.</p>

<p>When he arrived at his metropolitan destination
he gave the owner of the yellow Bus a
beautiful bawl for not helping him with his little
belly-leather suit-case, and on the way up to
the hotel he complained to his fellow passengers
about the rickety old boat, and wondered why
there were no taxicabs in the dump.</p>

<p>When he was assigned to his room at the
Luke’s Rock Hotel he kicked like a trapped
rabbit because it was a walk-up. And when he
saw the room he threw up both good old farm-knotted
hands and said it wouldn’t do a-tall.
They gave him another room and he went over
and felt the bed and said the mattress was about
as soft and responsive as the Town Scales.</p>

<p>When he came down for breakfast next morning
and the Proprietor with his little strive-to-please
face asked him how he had slept, he
growled back “Rotten!” and lumbered into the
dining room.</p>

<p>When the food came on, he complained that
the butter was rancid, the rolls were doughy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the coffee was like turpentine, the eggs were
boiled 3-3/4 minutes instead of 3-5/8 minutes as
ordered, and the service was fierce.</p>

<p>A silent, contended-looking man sat opposite
Ezekiel. He thanked the waitress with the thin
Face and receding Future every time she
brought him anything, and he seemed to relish
the little meal as much as anybody could with a
72-centimetre dub sitting opposite.</p>

<p>Finally Ezekiel addressed the silent man.
“This Road Life is certainly fierce, ain’t it?”,
he said, pushing back his plate and yanking his
napkin from under his red chin.</p>

<p>“It is,” replied the Man. “But it wouldn’t
be, if four-flushers like you would keep off it.”
Zeek stared, with jaws ajar.</p>

<p>“You are just an ordinary single-cylinder
rum,” went on the stranger, “that never knew
anything better than a corn-husk mattress and
large beans soaked in hot water, until you got
a job on the Road. Some day you may learn
that the man who has travelled most, kicks
least, and that the quickest way to tell a cheap
staller is to see how he adapts himself to Road
conditions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>



<p>And with this caustic valedictory, the speaker
got up from the table and left the room.
Ezekiel, flushed and fast foundering, intended
to get up too, and tell the fellow what he thought
of him, but decided to keep his seat when he
saw about nine feet of man arise from the table.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now Ezekiel Whiffle might have sieved
through something of benefit from this experience
had he been given time for reflection.
But he had to turn his thought to selling those
14 carloads that his Sales Manager had told him
were crouching for a chance to spring into his
brand new Order Book.</p>

<p>Besides, he was in no position to get a close-up
on himself while he still had a Roll and
represented the largest factory of its kind in
the country.</p>

<p>Thus when he went to see the Trade his ego
again got in the way and he couldn’t see that
in this grand, free game of Commerce, it is the
Buyer who has the right of Free Speech while
the Seller must temporize and simulate. At
least the Seller must temp and sim up to the
time the Order is signed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">
<img src="images/illus111.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="salesman standign on suitcase trying to mesmerize man whose head is on desk, dog looking on in background" />
<div class="caption">Hypnotizing the Buyer</div>
</div>

<p>He can then go around the corner, if he wants
to, and put his thumb to his nose or call the
Buyer anything he can think up that doesn’t
carry too far along the etheric waves. But
to indulge any such feeling before one is off
and premises is to invite probable loss of Sale
and possible kick in neck.</p>

<p>But Zeekie, the poor smelt, got it all twisted
and thought it was war-time and that Buyers
were going to come up and kiss him when he
arrived and ask him how all the folks were, and
carry his suit-case for him, just because he had
something to sell.</p>

<p>When they didn’t do it, but on the contrary,
went right on reading and signing letters and
transacting routine office business all the time
he was talking to them, as Buyers in normal
seasons enjoy doing, Zeekie felt that his dignity
was being shot at from ambush, and so he began
telling his Prospects different things that they
could do if they didn’t want to buy his celebrated
goods.</p>

<p>While no physical harm befell Ezekiel during
these clashes, no orders befell him either, and
after working the whole surrounding county<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and netting nothing but a large ostrich egg, he
sat down at the wabbly hotel writing-desk on
Saturday night and sent the Sales Manager a
Report about those fourteen carloads that made
that astute little Baked Bean shoot to the
scantlings when he read it on Monday morning.</p>

<p>It took the Bostonian about one full minute
after he struck terra cotta again to realize that
Ezekiel was down with a violent case of Sales-manic
Inflation that could be cured only by the
knife. So he promptly cut off Zeke’s job and
wired him to take the Fifteen Dollars he still
had of Dear Firm’s expense money and paddle
back to the Old Home Hamlet with it.</p>

<p>Now we come on with the anti-climax, the
fall of the action, and the close, thus preserving
the dramatic unities and giving our readers
that sense of relief which a concluding announcement
of ours always brings.</p>

<p>When the Hotel Proprietor received the fateful
telegram Monday noon and delivered it
personally to Ezekiel Whiffle at the breakfast
table, the large bucolic appetite which Ezekiel
had been vigorously feeding, suddenly and unceremoniously
departed, leaving a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
shredded wheat biscuit midway between his
incisors and the outside of his face. In fact
he entirely forgot it was there until he came
to, several minutes or aeons afterward, and
tried to pass a glass of water along the parched
pathway of his oesophagus.</p>

<p>On the thirty-seventh reading of the Farewell
Proclamation, Ezekiel pulled himself together
sufficiently to get up from the table and go out
and announce to the Proprietor he was leaving
for Chicago on the 3:37. The painstaking little
Prop observed for the first time a human note
in Zeke’s way of putting things.</p>

<p>He suggested that there was a fast train an
hour later that carried all Pullmans and got in
four hours sooner, if Zeke cared to drive over to
the B. Q. &amp; X. junction a mile away. Zeke
thanked him (1st thank recorded) and said he
had just as soon take the Day Coach Train as
he was only going to be on it a day and a night.</p>

<p>Zeke went upstairs to pack his things and
had a feeling that his room somehow was much
larger and more comfortable than he had
thought it was, and he sort of hated to give it
up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>When the yellow bus came alongside for the
3:37 and the driver attempted to toss Zeke’s
suit-case up on the roof, Zeke took it away
from him and said he guessed he’d walk to the
station and get the fresh air. The driver asked
if he might take the suit-case anyway; but Zeke
feared a nickle tip might be expected and he
pulled it back and started off for the Station.</p>

<p>The Bus rumbled past Zeke on the way and
Zeke thought they had painted it or something.
Fifteen minutes later when he was still a half
mile from the Station with but 10 minutes to
spare, and had just shifted his baggage from
hand to hand for the eleventh time, and was
sweating like a Madras coolie, he got to thinking
what a nice accomodation a Bus was anyway
for a little jerkwater like Luke’s Rock,
and wished he had hopped it at the Hotel.</p>

<p>The 3:37 was one hour and fifty-nine minutes
late but Zeke didn’t have anything to attend to
at destination that he couldn’t do just as well
sitting here; so he continued his reflections
about Life in general and didn’t grouse even to
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>After riding a hundred and fifty years on the
Day Coach, Zeke finally reached Chicago with
a stiff neck and swollen underpinning but meek
as a mujik. As he was hobbling out of the busy
Railway Station a Red Cap passed him toting
two big suit-cases. They had a million labels
pasted all over them and as Zeke humped along
behind, he began to inspect the curiosity.</p>

<p>He was reading “Bombay,” “Constantinople,”
“Cairo” and a lot of other names that
he had never heard before, and was wondering
what State they were in, when he heard a voice
just behind him call to the Red Cap: “Here,
Boy, put them on this taxi.”</p>

<p>Ezekiel looked up and beheld the Big Silent
Man—the man who had imparted the much
needed but disregarded advice on the occasion
of Zeke’s first meal at somebody else’s expense.</p>

<p>“Blackstone Hotel,” said the Big Man as he
handed the Red Cap a quarter and stepped into
the Taxi.</p>

<p>That night in a wee inside room on the fourth
floor of the Lake Smell Dollar Up sat Ezekiel
Whiffle trying to read the Help Wanted columns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
by the dim light that spluttered from a broken
gas fixture over the narrow spring-tooth bed.</p>

<p>He was a sadder but a wiser Ambassador of
Commerce.</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 10<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Man Who Organized Manufacturers</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a><br /><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p class='drop-cap'>A &nbsp;TIRED Business Man sat at his busy
desk cleaning his nails with his paper-knife
and lamenting in his tired-businessman’s
heart the lack of organization among
manufacturers.</p>

<p>The name of this particular t. b. Man was
Willyums and he was well-to-do and had a
separate pair of suspenders for each pair of
trousers.</p>

<p>“Just look at the situation,” sighed our fervent
plugger for united action. “Here we
manufacturers are, all knifing one another like
a squirming bunch of inch-browed dagoes, when
we ought to be solidly organized and working
as a single unit against the iniquitous principle
of labor organization.”</p>

<p>At this point in Willyums’ little round
soliloquy the Office Beetle crawled in and
handed him his morning’s mail.</p>

<p>Willyums picked up the letter and read it
carefully. It was from a friendly Compett who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
complained bitterly about the Government’s
unfair discrimination, and he asked Willyums
to offer a suggestion how to head off all such
pernicious activity.</p>

<p>This gave Willyums a great wide opportunity
to ventilate his views on the crying necessity
for cooperative action among manufacturers.</p>

<p>He dictated a letter that was all muscle and
fibre. In it he urged the importance of all
manufacturers organizing for their mutual protection.
He stated that only through unselfishness
on the part of Each, could the good of All
be served; and original things like that.</p>

<p>Willyums then drafted another snorter to
send out to such other manufacturers as he was
on speaking terms with, and he pleaded with
them to put their shoulders to the wheel and
make every sacrifice for the furtherance of the
Cause.</p>

<p>He said that any man who would not give up
his time whole-heartedly to the work was a
stumbling-block in the march of Progress, and
he coined other metaphors and epigrammatic
phrases that made his letter sizzle and spit like
a war-whooper at the Big Grove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>When the “copy” was typewritten and delivered
back to Willyums to read and enjoy, he
scanned it hurriedly a few dozen times and
then handed it to his Advertising-Manager and
told that groove-dweller to cut out all the personal
pronouns so the Trade wouldn’t think it
came from J. Ham Lewis and then gallop the
letter off to all the names on the list.</p>

<p>The responses that fluttered back were very
encouraging. Everybody seemed strong for
organizing at once, and several letters indicated
subdued excitement.</p>

<p>A number of leading manufacturers soon got
together and perfected a temporary organization
and selected a name for the new Association
that read like a serial story.</p>

<p>Business matters of a pressing nature prevented
Willyums from attending the first meeting,
but he wrote a strong letter of endorsement
and it was read at the morning session and was
much enjoyed by All Those Present as well as
himself.</p>

<p>At this Conference it was decided to hold a
big meeting of the whole Trade and get things
going like a busy shipyard, and the place and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
date were fixed well in advance so that nobody
could stall out.</p>

<p>Willyums wrote the Secretary back another
shoulder-to-the-wheel letter and said he would
be there positivoli. But when the time slid up
for him to set sail, he and his wife had a
Breathitt County difference of opinion which
threatened to end in Woodlawn Cemetery. It
started about her always leaving the icebox door
open, and finished up with a pungent polemic
on his sensitiveness and all-round worthlessness
as a marital leaning post.</p>

<p>Willyums naturally wanted to stick in the
ring till the finish, so he was obliged to wire
The Boys that he couldn’t be at the meeting and
to go ahead without him.</p>

<p>The Meeting proved to be a Great Success
and a date was fixed for the First Annual Convention
which was to be held at Wagon Springs,
Va., and all members were notified to be on
hand and to bring their wives and colorless
daughters along to enjoy the Entertainment
Features and drink of the health-giving waters
generously provided by the Hotel Management,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
with the slight assistance of Nature, at five
cents per glass or one cent per paper cup.</p>

<p>Willyums invited Comrade Wife to accompany
him and helped her to get her hat-box
through the door and shut the cover of her
yawning trunk and pack into his own little tin-trimmed
steamer all the things she had forgotten
to put in her travelling bungalow.</p>

<p>When Willyums arrived at Wagon Springs
the Hotel people gave him the customary welcome
of The Hotel Successful which consists in
telling the train-tuckered visitor that they have
no record of any reservation for him and that
he will have to sleep on the Town Pump or up
in the pigeons’ quarters.</p>

<p>Willyums smoothed out the bulge in his shirt-bosom
and told the Emperor back of the desk
that he was there to attend The Convention,
and as soon as he said this, he lost the two
good sleeping-chances referred to up-page.</p>

<p>This made him as sore as a blistered heel
and he went straight to the Twelfth Assistant
Manager and told him (the 12th Ass’t Manager)
that if it had not been for him (Willyums),
there would be no Convention at all, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
he (12th Ass’t Manager) would not be running
full-up in his (Mgr’s) old Hotel, and that if he
(M) did not at once provide him (W) with
suitable accomodations, there was going to be
a small but efficient funeral around there.</p>

<p>Willyums got the accomodations all right,
including a washstand and neat little ash tray
to put his ashes in; but it was so late when he
and Mrs. Willyums hit the hessian that they
did not open up until 10 o’clock next morning,
and then he had to go and dig up the lost
luggage so that Madame could drape her
matronly Fig. in a new child’s dress.</p>

<p>As a consequence Willyums did not get to the
opening session of the Convention but he
pumped palms with a number of delegates and
said he would see them surely at the afternoon
session.</p>

<p>The afternoon session was scheduled for 2
o’clock, and so the delegates got there promptly
at 3. Willyums was somewhere about the 3rd
hole when the meeting was called to order
because Mrs. Willyums was just a cub at golf
and insisted on doing the 18 no matter what
happened. They sweated back to the hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
along about sundown, barely on speaking terms
because he had told her that the woman did not
live who would not cheat at golf.</p>

<p>The next morning Willyums announced
solemnly to his unselfish helpmeet that he was
going to attend the remaining sessions of the
Convention or bust. Whereupon Mrs. Willyums
let loose a torrent of real tears and told him
what a shrimp he was to bring her along and
then keep her cooped up in a little ingrowing
room when they might both be riding in the
mountains and getting some fresh air.</p>

<p>Willyums was a highly sensitized man and
could not endure lachrymal leaks, and it did
not take him long to give in. In fact he caved
in, and accompanied his considerate little wife
on horseback, and they had a very nice time and
both agreed that the afternoon would positively
be his to spend at the closing session of the
Convention.</p>

<p>When they returned to the Hotel Willyums
learned that the Convention had disposed of
all pending matters at the preceding session
and had decided to adjourn <i>sine die</i> and give
the last afternoon over to Unalloyed Pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Willyums met several delegates coming out
of the Convention Hall and they told him they
did not know what they should have done without
his generous cooperation, and thanked him
for the Great Assistance he had been to them
all since the very beginning.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>FLOPPINGHAM WATERDELL sat in his
office, feet erect, smoking his morning
sisal.</p>

<p>And nursing along his habitual grouch
against Dear Firm.</p>

<p>Six months before, Floppingham Waterdell
had been stricken with the honor of Branch
Manager.</p>

<p>It was the biggest job he had ever managed
to throw in all his long speckled career, but for
some foolish reason Dear Firm thought they
had hold of a Whale when they fished him out
of the deep blue sea of Job Searchers.</p>

<p>“The utter planlessness of their work,”
sighed Floppingham, re-crossing his unexercised
legs and taking another long, legumenous
puff at the root of all evil.</p>

<p>“They send me here to take charge of an
office that has heretofore been conducted absolutely
without system, and then they expect me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to go out and do business without telling me
where they want me to go, or how they expect
me to go about it. They scuttle my plans and
they don’t offer any themselves. All they say
is, ‘Go get the business.’”</p>

<p>“All work should be planned beforehand,”
continued Floppingham, reflectively. “No
business man should attempt to do business
until he knows his territory thoroughly and the
character of his Prospects—even down to their
peculiarities and hobbies, thus eliminating lost
motion in the Approach, and simplifying the
road of ingress.”</p>

<p>From the foregoing irridescent little exerpt
from Floppingham Waterdell’s daily conferences
with himself over the deficiencies of his
Firm, the reader has come to the conclusion,
or not, as the case may be, that Floppingham
was himself a rhinoceros of no small heft when
it came to Business Efficiency.</p>

<p>And indeed Flop was.</p>

<p>Every file in the office, every colored thumbtack
on the map, every drawer of his desk,
every card-index, chart, letter and cuspidor
sang of The Office Efficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>And all accomplished within six short,
shrimpy months!</p>

<p>For examp: When Floppingham took charge
of the dump, you couldn’t find a letter in the
files without looking for it. Three months later
you didn’t have to go to the files at all when
you wanted to look at a letter. You would go
to a Card Index where you found all the meaty
paragraphs of the letter arranged on a card
alphabetically, chronologically and hypodermically,
including the writer’s telephone number
and all such other thrilling news as appears at
the apex of the average letterhead.</p>

<p>As a check against error, you then would get
out the original letter from the regular files and
compare the card with the letter, or the letter
with the card, or vice versa, and the trick was
done! Positively no plush curtains or false
bottoms to deceive you!</p>

<p>It took one girl only four months to get
this system in shape so she could take off the
skid-chains.</p>

<p>Before Floppingham assumed charge, nobody
around the office even knew how many steps a
thirsty bookkeeper had to take to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
water-tank at the opposite side of the room and
get back to the revolving perch. Nor did anybody
know the amount of time that was consumed
per step in such a wild orgy.</p>

<p>But Floppingham, through his original system
of Step Reduction, figured out that if the
bookkeeper would lengthen his stride to the
Thirst Muffler, he would thereby reduce the
number of steps; or, in other well selected
words, reduce the time consumed in wasting
Dear Firm’s time drinking water.</p>

<p>Thus if ten steps were saved through Step
Standardization, and each step consumed one
second, that would mean a net saving of ten
seconds per trip to the Trough. Granted that
six trips per day were made during the winter
months, and six hundred during the Dog
Season, the result would be a grand total of
umpty-ump hours per year per clerk, or a net
saving of ifty-ift dollars per year to the
Business.</p>

<p>And just to show you to what a fine point the
reasoning of the Efficiency Engineer can be
spun out without snapping, we will add that
Floppingham always took into consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the length of an applicant’s legs when hiring a
clerk.</p>

<p>These were but a couple of Floppingham’s
efficiency installations. He had a million of
them. They ranged all the way from Sales
Planning to counting the number of puffs to a
hemp panatella. He wore out the seat of his
trouserial furniture figuring them out.</p>

<p>One day Dear Firm sent him a letter swathed
in purple satire, suggesting that Efficiency was
a means, not an end, and that if he felt that his
Branch could do a little Business once in a
while without greatly impairing its uselessness,
they would send him a bright young man with
a plaid vest to help him make sales.</p>

<p>Whereupon Floppingham Waterdell adjusted
his glasses, took up his efficient pen that had
pulled him through many a stall, and wrote out
plans and specifications covering the kind and
quality of man he desired.</p>

<p>It is possible that the talent and virtues and
experience of the Human Race, taken as a
whole, might have perhaps been able to squeeze
up to Floppingham’s requirements as set forth
by Flop under numerous heads and sub-heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
designated as (a) (b) (c) and so forth—the
kind, you know, that many Government employes
and other bluffologists revel in.</p>

<p>When Dear Firm received from Floppingham
this last brilliant contribution to the
records of Commercial Pish, they winked one
eye clear to the roots and then dictated the
following Appreciation:</p>

<p>“We don’t know just when it happened, nor
just how it happened, but the Business World
today is infested with a new stripe of grafter—the
Efficiency Eel, to which School you seem to
have a Rhodes Scholarship.</p>

<p>“Efficiency Eels are Word Wizards and
Figure Fixers of a very clever order, and we
poor uneducated kanoops of the workaday-and-night
world have been caught by the swing of
their phrases and the flare of their ‘facts.’</p>

<p>“Not a yap of them ever did a day’s work
since he left college, and couldn’t get out and
sell a bill of postage stamps at 50 and 5. Instead
of planning for business, they make a
business of planning. They are always getting
ready, but they never start. They are piffling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
pollywogs on the plane of the Practical, but
past grand masters in the philosophy of Bunk.</p>

<p>“The reason they keep planning and organizing
and systemizing all the time is because they
know they are nix glox on Performance. And
plans without performance are like teeth without
jaws.</p>

<p>“Show us the gunk that is always laying the
blame for his own failure to lack of efficiency
and system in his employer’s business, and
we’ll show you a gunk who is stalling for fair.</p>

<p>“For six months, come Yom Kippur, you
have been ‘planning’ to bag a little business,
and if we kept you there for six years, or six
hundred years, you would still be planning.
You are a planner and not a worker. You can
MAKE plans all right, but you could not
EXECUTE one of them if it laid its head on the
block and handed you the axe.</p>

<p>“It isn’t your fault, Mr. Stall, that we have
been slow to get your curves. We are just like
hundreds of other firms—just plain, ordinary
yappoos who would rather hire an outside man
at $20,000 a year to do nothing but plan, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
give half the salary to an inside man and have
him perform. But now that we are ON, would
you mind considering yourself submarined and
greatly oblige etc.”</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>A &nbsp; POVERTY-PANNED mill owner who
had only been able to finger in a bare ten
million after twenty gruelling years of
grimy grind at Board Meetings and Stock-holders’
Seances, sat wearily at his flat-topped
Mahogany and heaved a long abdominal sigh
at the hellward tendency of the children of
today.</p>

<p>“It’s all due to the Pernicious Activity of
these agitators,” he said, wiping away a great
big humanitarian tear. “All that I am today
I owe to the hardships I suffered when a child.”</p>

<p>Here he turned on a few more big salty boys
and then continued; “Poverty is a blessing and
an educator, and yet these here agitators come
along and want to take out of my mill the lucky
children that are having a chance through my
bounty to become worthy citizens of this great,
glorious Republic of ours.”</p>

<p>He was just on the verge of adding a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
trembling mushmellows about the stars and
stripes waving in the free, pure air of America
when his emotion got a hackenschmidt stranglehold
on his large oily thorax, and he couldn’t
splutter it across.</p>

<p>When he had recovered his composure and
wiped the sweat-beads from his nice thick neck,
he got to thinking some more of all he had
done for the town by giving employment to its
skinny-legged children, and putting more money
in circulation, and all that sort of fly-smacked
mediaeval economics, and he choked up again
at the thought of how little his beneficence
had been appreciated.</p>

<p>In his great paternal heart he knew that his
motive in doing all this unselfish thing for the
thin-wristed tots of the town was as pure as
the lotos flower, and that there was no low-lying
thought of the good old coin he was pulling
down on the investment.</p>

<p>In fact he was so sure of it that when he
chanced one day to notice a wee ripple on the
sweet still sea of Graft in the shape of a parboiled
attempt to increase the children’s wages
from One Penny to Two Pennies, he was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
as indifferent as a gunless man in a tiger’s lair.</p>

<p>Many other little things went to show the
philanthropic purpose of King Paunch’s acts.
He had, for instance, a noonday feed served
to the child workers which enabled them to
romp joyfully back to the looms twenty minutes
sooner each day, and a little later he again
got busy with his short pencil and long head
and figured out how he could cut off a certain
yard space for a playground without cutting
off the profits.</p>

<p>He stood wide-legged and willing at all times
to prove to anybody that the children were better
off in his mill working ten hours a day than
they would be in their homes, and that when it
came to Loving Care and Attention the laughing
loom had any Day Nursery in the land walloped
to a wobble.</p>

<p>There was no opportunity, he contended, for
the youngsters to acquire vicious habits, except
a lint-cough, and by keeping them standing
all day catching threads to the rhythm of
the loom-buzz, they would not run up against
wicked temptation to Walk the Streets.</p>

<p>Every time he would get through telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
about his charitable works, he would feel for
his halo to see that it was on straight.</p>

<p>In certain moments of mental liberality he
would concede that his mill did not include
quite all the conveniences and comforts of
Heaven, but generally speaking, it was about
the most constructive hangout, from a physical,
mental and moral standpoint, that you could
find south of the Pearline Gates.</p>

<p>There was a touch of pathos in the sight of
this willing martyr to the cause of Progress
and Purity getting all sweatted up arguing his
side of the case against those fanatics who were
obsessed with the crazy notion that the place
for little children was in school.</p>

<p>Searching through history he found that all
the other great and good benefactors of the
Race had always run up against the cross or the
hemlock in time, and so whenever he was not
perorating with fist-pounding positives, he was
lying back sad-eyed and resigned, trying to acquire
a forgive-them-for-they-know-not-what-they-do
look, and breathing forgiveness heavily
through every pore.</p>

<p>In time—and now we are coming to the weep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
part of our throbbing tale—Colonel Razorback’s
friends began to notice that he was
throttling down physically to the point where
the only thing that could save him from losing
his appetite between meals was to send him
to Carlsbad.</p>

<p>Constant worriment over the passage of some
Law in the selfish interest of Public Good by
which he might have to give up his 500 precious
child charges to the ruthless and demoralizing
influence of home and school, reacted upon his
liver and it began to reach out and kick him
in the spine when he wasn’t looking.</p>

<p>There was not the least sign anywhere around
the organic or functional premises to indicate
that his condition was aggravated by the
thought that he might have to employ grown-ups
at slightly stretched wages, and we have
therefore no right to diagnose any man’s case
afar off.</p>

<p>We shall only say in passing, and without any
intimate relevancy to our story whatever, that
Colonel Hogshead was pained to the very quick-sand
to have to leave his young daughter and
his little cowlick-headed son to the tender mercies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of a private tutor, a governess, three
freckled servants, and their mother, but he managed
to bear up under it, and sail away to
Carlsbad.</p>

<p>Thus, after issuing Strict Instructions that
his own precious tendrils should breathe no second-hand
air, nor go out in the heat of the day,
nor study too hard, nor exercise when they were
the least bit tired, nor get less than 10 hours
sleep, nor eat anything not raised under glass,
he tore himself away, and, in due time, was
lying peaceful and fat in his deck-chair, rugged
in snugly and comfy, sleeping the sleep of the
Righteous, and dreaming contentedly of all that
he was today—all that the blessed privilege of
early poverty had made him.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>SLOBBINGS knew that motor cars had four
wheels and were owned by people who
could not afford them.</p>

<p>Slobbings’ wife was equally well up on the
subject. She was once acquainted with some
folks who had one of those graceful maroon
tonneaus with the little back door like a Hicksville
hotel bus, and she used to watch them
take up the floor and dive down into the basement
to fix the machinery every few miles when
something went wrong.</p>

<p>Slobbings knew only too well that the day
was coming when his wife would be asking
him why it was that they were always hoofing
it while their neighbors were jerking past in
neat little Fords.</p>

<p>He himself was razor-keen to sit back of a
steering wheel of his own and toot a big hebrew
horn at jumping pedestrians, but he decided
to lay low and let her spring the inevitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
question first so that when they bought a car
he could forever after blame her for everything
that happened this side of Mars.</p>

<p>The issue came up as expected when the
Spring flowers began to hatch, and the smell
of new mown gasolene was in the air.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Slobbings and his
wife sallied forth one sunny afternoon to feed
the motor microbe.</p>

<p>They passed right by the Ford agency but
couldn’t see it because they hadn’t a telescope.
Nothing less than a Twin Eight for them! They
spent about three hours of lumpy stalling
around the Automobile Shopping District pretending
they knew what The Man was talking
about, and concentrating on the relative merits
of wind shields and ignoring little unimportant
details like magnetos, carburetors, engines,
etc. But after getting familiar with prices, they
began to filter down into the Flivver class along
about evening-fall and were ready to stop feeling
upholstery and get down to cases.</p>

<p>Their decision finally perched upon a snappy,
unimpeachable, luxurious top-quality performer
which was priced at three figures, the tallest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
one of the three being under nine, although not
more than two or three flights under.</p>

<p>They owned the car all of one day when the
matrimonial bliss in which they had been soaring
was brought down, and both occupants
barely escaped with their lives.</p>

<p>It happened this way: Slobbings had been
under the droll hallucination that he could drive
the thing, and so he waved off the young man
from the Agency who had volunteered to show
him how to stay on a fairly wide road, and
started to cut loose with the levers himself, with
his Helpmeet at his right.</p>

<p>When the excitement subsided he took his
wife into the house and stood her in a corner
and made her solemnly swear that in future
whenever one was driving, the other was never
to cut in with criticism, contumely or contemptuous
comment at critical junctures, but
was to either sit tight or get out and pedal.</p>

<p>The next morning while Slobbings was at his
office trying to get his mind on work, his wife
sneaked over and got the demonstrator to throw
away his chew and put on his coat and give
her a lesson in driving the little pelican.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>That night when she and Slobbings started
out, it was she who insisted upon taking the
wheel, and this gave Slobbings the pleasure of
sitting on the thin edge of Uncertainty and
grabbing the Emergency Brake every time another
car could be discerned with the naked
eye coming toward them.</p>

<p>Whenever she tooted the horn to signal their
nervous approach, he would hand her the not-so-loud-dearie
caution, hissing said caution between
such teeth as he had not already ground
off during previous hair-breadth escapes.</p>

<p>If he happened to be the one driving, and
stuck out his wing to let the Traffic know he
was going to turn a corner in due season provided
he did not stall his engine, his wife would
tell him that it was not customary nor necessary
to injure one’s spine hanging so far over the
side of the car. In devious other ways she
vented her unstrung condition and frequently
referred warmly to his all-round hopelessness as
a level-headed driver.</p>

<p>There was a demoniacal something that came
and sat between them every time they got into
that car. The Dove of Peace never flew within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
five thousand miles of the tail light at any stage
of the tragedy.</p>

<p>Each got the idea that the other felt there
was nothing left around the car to be learned,
and this naturally led to fierce engagements in
which hand grenades were used freely on both
sides.</p>

<p>Every time he told her that she shifted her
gears like a steam riveter, she would spring
back and tell him between her teeth that he
couldn’t drive a nail, and then she’d follow
through with a mighty beanbammer about his
family not being very bright anyway, and no
wonder he couldn’t get anything past the
porphery.</p>

<p>She accused him of throwing out his chest
when he ought to be throwing out his clutch,
and he retaliated by charging her with imagining
she was Barney Oldfield because she could
cut around a moving van without losing more
than one mud guard.</p>

<p>In their refreshing evening drives together,
the one who would first discover that the Emergency
Brake was still on, would get right out
on the hood and crow and flap like a Hoosier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
cock in a congested corn-crib, making the other
naturally as pleased as a pup with its tail in
the door.</p>

<p>History does not recall that Slobbings and
his merry mate ever came to a corner that he
didn’t want to turn one way and she another,
nor that both ever desired the Top up or down
at the same time.</p>

<p>One day about six months after the Home
Breaker had been purchased, Slobbings met
with a serious business throw-back. No one was
to blame but himself. Motoring had interfered
with his Business and he had cut his Office from
his visiting list.</p>

<p>Among other things there was an over-ripe
note at the bank and he was obliged to produce
the necessary piastres within twelve hours. So
without slipping a syllable to his wife he up
and sold the car, receiving therefor an amount
so far below original cost that it made him dizzy
to look down at it.</p>

<p>A few days later he broke the news to the
Gentle One, and, after the lachrymal flood-gates
had been opened and closed again in the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
way, she braced up and said it was all right
and they would have to Be Brave.</p>

<p>A hell-hot evening in the following August
found Slobbings and his wife taking a nice
trolley ride out into the country for a sniff of
fresh ozone.</p>

<p>They were sitting side by side, looking over
the fields of waving wollypus, and he had his
arm around her.</p>

<p>Both were silent. They were thinking of the
same thing.</p>

<p>“Well anyway,” she said at last, “we <i>did</i>
have good times with the little car while it
lasted, didn’t we dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, love,” he replied softly, “those were
the happy days.”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Would-Be Sales Promoter</span></small></h2>

<p class='drop-cap'>ONE day a successful Manufacturer who
had become strongly addicted to Efficiency
Literature after making his pile,
sat down and reasoned with himself thus:</p>

<p>“Something is wrong with my business. The
Sales Increase for last year was only 120 percent.
It should have been 850 percent. The
fault lies with my Sales Manager.”</p>

<p>“True, he is a good slob, but he is not good
enough. My Salesmen all like him and plug
hard on his account, to say nothing of their
own; but they don’t plug hard enough.”</p>

<p>“What I need is a Sales Chief who is not
stocked up with the dry-bones of Salesmanship—someone
who comes from the outside and
brings a fresh, crisp point of view—someone
who knows nothing at all about the Selling
Game. That’s the stunt these days! My present
man is in a rut. Raus!”</p>

<p>The morning following this sparkling synthesis,
Comrade President called in the pre-damned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
S. M. and tied a campbell soup can to
his Promising Career and sent him clattering
up Main Street.</p>

<p>Then he grabbed a note-pad, scribbled off a
terse Classified Ad, pressed a button on the
waistline of his desk, and told the Office Poodle
to get it into the morning papers and quit
spitting on the radiator.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On a high stool in the Bookkeeping Department
of a certain Plumbers Supply House sat
an upright and painstaking young gentleman
who wrote an excellent hand, never erred in his
posting, and fainted when anybody turned the
ledger pages from the bottom instead of the top.</p>

<p>But of late years he had contracted a serious
case of correspondence-schoolitis and within
him was stirring strong the ambition to Become
An Executive And Earn Fifty Thousand A
Year.</p>

<p>He was firmly convinced that the only difference
between the man shoveling coal and the
man shoveling coin was a difference in Earning
Power, as told graphically in the pictures; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
so whenever the Boss wasn’t looking, he would
pull out his book and study up on how to increase
his Earning Power.</p>

<p>On this particular morning this particular
young gentleman had been casually perusing
the newspaper for a few hours prior to the
Boss’s arrival, and he had almost finished the
twenty-eighth page when his eye leeched upon
the advertisement of our friend the Efficiency
President about whom we were chatting
pleasantly before we went off on this spur.</p>

<p>“I feel the fingers of Fate upon my spine,”
said the young gentleman osteopathically, as
he clipped the Ad from the paper and slipped it
into the upper berth of his double-breasted
white waistcoat.</p>

<p>When the noon hour struck, it took him just
two and one-quarter minutes to slide down the
scaffolding of the high stool, grab his little
cardboard derby, and jump a passing trolley in
quest of the job.</p>

<p>But when he arrived at the factory, his Nerve
suddenly up and left for parts unknown. With
trembling ears, and muscles of the map twitching
like a mare’s flank shivering off flies, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
opened the office door. He didn’t burst it open
wildly like a cartman with a delivery receipt
for you to sign, or any important personage
like that. He opened it just wide enough to
squeeze through and scrape the buttons all off
his coat.</p>

<p>The man in charge knew of course what this
flickering taper had oozed in for. It was a
cinch he wasn’t some Kentucky customer calling
to raise hell about the last shipment. Only
a man looking for a job could behave like a
seidlitz powder and not arouse suspicion. So
he ushered him in to see the President.</p>

<p>Mister President, pushing back his whiskers
for oratorical clearance, delivered himself thus:</p>

<p>“Young Man,” he said, “have you any
reason, either apparent or hidden about the
premises, for thinking that you know any more
about Salesmanship than a squirrel knows about
Santa Claus?”</p>

<p>“No sir,” blurted the Dose of Salts, meaning
to say “yes” and bluff it out.</p>

<p>“Good!” broke in Uncle President. “You’ve
got the very qualification I’m looking for.</p>

<p>“And what name do you wag to?” queried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Monsieur Le President, well pleased with his
exceptional perceptive faculty.</p>

<p>“Elliott Buc——” But Pres. cut him short.
“Never mind the details,” he said.</p>

<p>“And now Elliott,” he continued, throwing
back an emphatic lapel and hooking his presidential
thumb into his vest pocket, “I am going
to make you my Sales Manager. You look and
act as unlike a Sales Manager as anything I’ve
ever seen this side of Lapland and that’s why
I think you’ll do. I’m working on a new system.
So get up off the floor there, and say ‘thank
you’—and GO TO IT!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Elliott’s full and complete name may be itemized
as follows: Elliott Buckingham Tudor-Smith.
But around the office they promptly
re-capped it under the appropriate and musical
monicker of “Ellie.”</p>

<p>They also noted that from the instant Ellie
landed the coveted job, his knees and his neck
began to stiffen like a steel bar, and there was
something in his manner that seemed to say:
“The President should be congratulated upon
his good judgment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole overburdened Office Staff were
stop-work observers of everything that went
on in the office from a giggly conversation
among the girls down to delivering a bottle of
crystal spring water for the ice-cooler, and of
course they all saw and remembered how Ellie
went into the President’s office on all fours to
apply for the job.</p>

<p>Hence when they now saw him swank past
them full of superior swish and driving his
heels to the floor like a Grenadier Guard, they
naturally began to develop that warmth of
fellowship toward him that one feels for the
cramps.</p>

<p>Had Elliott not been by profession a Bookkeeper,
he would have made a good Haberdasher.
When it came to practical Salesmanship
he had about as much experience as a
sponge diver. Hence he possessed many essential
qualifications of the modern blank-cartridge
Sales Director, as psychically discerned by the
President at the outset.</p>

<p>While Elliott might be described as a traveled
person, he was not what you would exactly call
a globe-trotter in the strict sense of said term.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
He had on several occasions joined the Sunday
Excursion to Churubusco, Indiana, with the
white duck panties and the blue serge Double
Breasted. Also he had been twice to Chicago;
once during his honeymoon, and once when he
went there to get his teeth filled, and in so
doing made the local horseshoer sore on him for
life.</p>

<p>We mention this irrelevancy merely to show
that when it came to skipping here and there
over the cornbelt, and getting back to the Home
Town safe and sound and unrobbed, Elliott
could hold his own with the best of them.</p>

<p>Elliott possessed still another essential to
successful latter-day sales management. He
was one rhinoceros on System. In less than
three months after he had set sail upon the
hazardous sea of Sales Promotion, he had
everything on the premises mapped and
charted and indexed and cross-indexed and sub-indexed
and super-indexed forty-seven different
ways.</p>

<p>Any ordinary question put to him about the
Business or the Weather would be followed by
the pulling out of numerous little drawers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
card-indexes and files and charts and things
until the Questioner had forgotten what it was
he asked about, or had gone on to other matters
or to sleep.</p>

<p>Elliott’s highest qualification for his job, however,
lay in his early-discovered ability to write
a very superior quality of nagging letter to the
Salesmen under him. When it came to the
Quibble &amp; Nag stuff, Elliott had every corn-fed
Sales Manager in the land rolled up like a
carpet.</p>

<p>Having himself never sold a Bill of Goods
in his tiny conventional life, and being barely
able to tell the Goods from a large knobby sack
of apples without first walking all around them
and squinting at them from different angles, he
was insured at all times against writing the
Sales Force upon anything that might be of
any importance whatever to the Business.</p>

<p>For instance, when the Firm’s crack salesmanic
shot of the Western Territory was aching
like an ingrowing toenail for some
constructive suggestion from Headquarters
concerning a Big Deal he was trying to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
across, he would receive a three-page Satire
from Ellie criticizing him for scoring up 168
miles in his Expense Book when the R. R. Guide
showed plainly and Unmistakably that the
actual distance from point to point was only
167 miles.</p>

<p>And when some other Sales Wizard would
send in a C/L Order from some dotty dorp off
in the scrub of Oblivion where The House had
never before sold a Lincoln Penny’s worth of
their fully-guaranteed Stuff, Ellie would
promptly press Button No. 2 (gawd, how Eddie
loved to press those buttons!) and then dictate
to the anaemic stenographer a couple of pages
of acid contumely, telling how surprised The
Writer was that an Order from a territory of
such potential greatness should not have called
for ten carloads instead of one carload.</p>

<p>Ellie of course never hiked out on The Road
himself and therefore never knew whether a
given Territory was potentially great or potentially
punk, nor whether one carload was a
slashing big Order or a paltry pee-wee, but he
always had to write cheery stuff like yon foregoing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
because this is the particular phobia of
the desk-reared Sales Manager.</p>

<p>Ellie never believed in complimenting a Road
Rat and running the risk of impairing the
gunk’s proper perspective of his work and maybe
cause him to slap in an extra bus-fare on the
strength of it.</p>

<p>In short, Ellie’s skilful management naturally
succeeded in putting The Boys in such excellent
spirits that every time they got a letter from
him they felt like shooting up a Home for
Incurables.</p>

<p>But in due and good time it came to pass that
all those Salesmen on Elliott’s staff that were
not buying clapboard homes on installment,
slapped in their resignations and politely told
Ellie and His System to go to hellenstaythere.</p>

<p>This, however, did not cause so much as a
tropical ripple on the sea of Serenity upon
which Elliott Buckingham Tudor-Smith was
gliding so smoothly. As fast as one Salesman
would up and kick off his breechin’, Ellie
would hire another, and each time he got a
better man than the man who quit. After a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
while he had as fine a bunch of Ribbon Clerks
as ever lined up against a soda fountain on a
reckless Saturday afternoon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But all things come to him who stoops over
when the boot of Wrath draws nigh. At the
end of the Fiscal Year, which is the time of
reckoning and erasing and general all ’round
fixing of fake entries, Comrade President
called Elliott into his private office, leaned back
in his executive Swivel, and relieved himself of
the following ballad:</p>

<p>“Young man,” he said, feeling for his tonsils
to see that they were on straight, “I have just
looked over the Sales Record for the year during
which you have been benching in the Sales
Department, and I find that Sales have fallen so
shockingly low that they ought to be in a
Rescue Home.</p>

<p>“When I gave you that job I was following
out a plan that has proven successful in many
cases as shown by magazine articles. I thought
you would make a good Sales Manager because
you knew nothing about Selling, just as the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
organizers of Business Men’s Associations are
Kendallville Professors who know nothing
about Business, and the best writers of Efficiency
Stuff are men who file their correspondence
on a hook, and the most dazzling
Shop Management Talksters those who heave
a wheelbarrow over a fence and never see the
gate.</p>

<p>“I now see that I was not only Dead Wrong
but absolutely bughouse. I might as well expect
to get a good hair-cut by a piano-tuner or
boxing-lessons from a Tea Tenor, as to get a
good Sales Manager out of any man who gets
off a train head-first and doesn’t know a Sample
Case from a schmeerkase.</p>

<p>“In twelve long, lanky months you haven’t
yet got the lie of the 2nd hole on the Selling
Course, and I have a sneaky suspicion that you
wouldn’t get around the first Nine in ninety
years.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t get a Salesman’s point of view
if he stuck you in the leg with it, and for the
same reason you couldn’t see the Dealer’s slant
on things, nor the House’s policy if you trained
a super-telescope on them.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides all that, you have been so busy
trying to think out some new high-sounding
title for your job, and writing brainless Briefs
on Salesmanship for the tired Trade Press,
and attending so many noonday foolishers
called Business Luncheons, that you haven’t
yet had time to learn whether our Line of
Goods is made to wear or to eat.</p>

<p>“Here and there in this worryful World of
Business you will occasionally find some old
moss-chest who still holds that Salesmanship
means SELLING GOODS, and not Charts,
Maps, Conferences and After Dinner Oratory.
I now see, after a brief but total eclipse of
Horse Sense due to too much reading and too
little thinking, that I am one of those Old
Timers myself.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame <i>you</i>,” he went on, unmindful
of a pair of quaking pants before him, “for
getting the Bilged Bean right at the crank-up,
for you have never shinned the rough spots of
Salesmanship yourself, and you haven’t got the
imagination of a moving van.</p>

<p>“The fault is all mine,” he concluded, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that’s a matter that doesn’t cut any cantaloupe
now. So get back to the High Stool and ply
your penmanship! I’ve decided to hire a
Regular. Voetsak!”</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>CLARENCE and Bud lived in the same
dotty dorp and went to the same little
red-necked school.</p>

<p>Clarence was a studious piece of Rocquefort
and scored 100 in everything.</p>

<p>Bud’s monthly report looked like the stock
quotations in a demoralized market.</p>

<p>Whenever anything was pulled in the shape
of Rough House, Bud was usually the Chairman
of the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Clarence, on yon other hand, always conducted
himself in an Exemplary Manner and
wore leggins.</p>

<p>There was a big manufacturing plant in the
town and when the boys finished school they
naturally went to work there. Everybody did.
The whole force was born and raised within
sound of the whistle.</p>

<p>The Export Manager had never been clear
across the County Line. That’s why he was the
Export Manager.</p>

<p>Clarence was given an important clerkship
in the office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Bud likewise received Four Dollars a week.</p>

<p>Bud pinched enough postage stamps to make
it Four Twenty Five.</p>

<p>Time went on.</p>

<p>And on.</p>

<p>Clarence built up a record for piety, punctuality,
faithful fidoism and fussy attention to details
that made every aspiring clerk in the place
eat the carrot of envy every time they thought
of him and his little kuppenheimer.</p>

<p>Bud was the only one who couldn’t see even
a dim outline of Clarence’s sterling virtues.</p>

<p>His psychology was as different from Clarence’s
“as day is from night,” to put it originally
yet cleverly.</p>

<p>Bud was a wrecker of rules and a punisher of
precedent.</p>

<p>He couldn’t see where certain non-essential
things cut any large and influential ice in the
great game of Business.</p>

<p>And he voiced his views with such hobnailed
frankness that Clarence daily expected to see
Bud popped from the Payroll.</p>

<p>He cautioned Bud repeatedly in a patronizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
high tenor to censor his stuff or be prepared
for the Hiking Certificate.</p>

<p>Time went on some more.</p>

<p>Bud still stuck.</p>

<p>The predictions of Clarence and all the other
starchy little stallers proved to be punk and
peanutty.</p>

<p>Comrade Boss seemed to take considerable
shine to Bud, but none of the tall-collared gentry
could get it at all.</p>

<p>Bud didn’t smoke his cigarettes around in the
alley. And he played billiards on the Sabbath.
And his business letters lacked dignity they
said, although the stuff got over.</p>

<p>The reason the Boss liked Bud can be explained
very simply, without the aid of music,
motion pictures or other contraptions calculated
to emphasize and impress.</p>

<p>The reason was this: Bud had IDEAS.</p>

<p>Now an idea is something that only Individuals
are susceptible to. Persons never contract
them.</p>

<p>Bud was an Individual. The rest of the Office
Staff was an office staff.</p>

<p>If an idea had ever wandered in among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
them, it would have been unable to establish its
identity. Nobody would have known the
stranger at all.</p>

<p>Bud didn’t see why things should be done
a certain way just because old man Noah did
them that way.</p>

<p>Nor why a business letter should throb with
about as much human interest as a Report on
Weights and Measures, just because it was
called a business letter.</p>

<p>Bud was also dead set against office stalling.</p>

<p>He never threw the bluff that he was all
fevered up with work when he wasn’t doing
anything but tinker with a hangnail.</p>

<p>And when he worked on a job, he worked to
produce, not to prolong.</p>

<p>Further, Bud declined to have it in for the
Boss simply because he was the Boss. And at
every session of the Rappers’ League he was as
open about it as a woman with a secret.</p>

<p>All these things Burra Boss quietly eyed-in
from time to time, as Bosses have the lowdown
habit of doing.</p>

<p>And so one bright Spring Morning about
eleven minutes past ten he called Bud into the
Throne Room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Young man,” quoth he, “you have been for
several years sitting in with a bunch of office
beadles without becoming one of them.</p>

<p>“It is no simple cinch for a young man to
hold himself aloof from the piffle and puff of
Office Politics and to evolve ideas in an intellectual
graveyard. I take this occasion to congratulate
you, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Thank you sir,” quoth Bud, wondering if
he was in for something more negotiable than
a congratulation.</p>

<p>“And furthermore,” quoth on the Boss, “I
have decided to promote you to the sales-managership
of this hustling hive at twice the
salary we have been smothering you with
heretofore.”</p>

<p>Bud attempted to quoth back, but there
wasn’t a quoth left in his quothary.</p>

<p>Too full for coherent utterance, he merely
made various motions indicating large appreciation,
such as bowing, tapping his shirt bosom,
winding his watch, and so on.</p>

<p>And then he backed modestly out of the
room.</p>

<p>Into the Salesmanager’s sanctum Bud carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the same dashing disregard for precedent and
prehistoric policies that had landed him the
hundred-and-fifty dollar job.</p>

<p>Inside two more years he had established
such a ripping record that the Boss made him
General Manager of the Works and raised him
to Two Hundred.</p>

<p>The Boss also let Bud in on a percentage of
the profits equaling one-sixteenth of one percent
beginning with the tenth year after it went
into effect.</p>

<p>As for Clarence, he is still sitting neat and
erect somewhere in one of the outer offices
checking things at a small desk.</p>

<p>In between glances at comrade clock, he
wonders how the Boss could have possibly made
such a busy blunder as to pop Bud to the top
and overlook real genius.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” he ejaculates, and turns once
more to his checking.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>MARK McMARK was one of those good-lord-look-at-this-desk
Business Bees
that fish their noonday grub out of a
Pie Incubator and rush up and pay what they
think is approximately correct, and then snap
back to their offices like a rubber band.</p>

<p>When it came to Fortune Farming, Mark
McMark was cutting a good clean furrow and
he was as happy as the day is wide. In spite
of this, he decided to get married.</p>

<p>He did not first make up his mind to rivet-up,
and then roll up his sleeves and go out on a
hunt for the girl.</p>

<p>On the contrary Mark had a keen contempt
of large circumference for that type of male
kanoop that sits around his bachelor dugout
until the microbe of Melancholy begins to take
up its winter quarters in his corrugated heart,
and then decides he wants a Home and goes out
and sizes up every girl he meets like a bumpkin
in to buy a bullock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark believed that Love chases not her own.
He said that for every masculine mammal there
was a feminine complement browsing somewhere
along Life’s ranch, and that all you had
to do was to stick around and the Right One
would loom up over the hills before sunset.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in Mark’s mind that the
Right One had credentialed in his case. He
said he could tell it in any one of a dozen ways,
no matter who held the cards. He was so
german-sure about it that he began to get sort
of section-boss with all his bachelor friends and
told them that they were only Half Men and
he spread considerable First Lesson Philosophy
wherever he went.</p>

<p>All the married men in the office used to sit
tightly non-commital when Mark raved. Their
silence was about as quiet as a Miners Protest
Meeting but it got right by Mark every time.
He just kept on baiting everybody and maintained
that no Business Man ever worked at
maximum efficiency until he was buckled and
had a man’s responsibility and some incentive
to spur him on to Greater Achievement.</p>

<p>In time Mark and the Right One were lawfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
wished on each other and duly preachered
and Lohengrined, and they began to Keep
House in an Apartment, which translated
means that they began to stall less and learn
more.</p>

<p>Mark didn’t have time to tell Her any longer
about the Big Things he was going to do. It
took all his time to explain the Little Things
that he didn’t do. He got better acquainted with
Her every time he forgot to leave an order at
the Grocer’s, or carved the lamb from left to
right instead of from right to left.</p>

<p>Mark also learned that he had oddly shaped
ears, mispronounced many words, walked like a
Yiddish cloak and suit maker, and slept with
his face ajar. The breakfast table became a
sort of observatory for physiological and temperamental
defects, and the pastime developed
to such an engrossing point, that Mark began
to forget about the office and sort of hung
around the house like a haze, fearing to lift,
lest he miss a good opening for a caustic comeback.</p>

<p>Whenever the satire ran low on acid, an
ominous lull would follow, during which nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
could be heard but the sullen click of knives
and forks, and the ebb and flow of coffee along
Mark’s aesophagus. Then suddenly the silence
would crack wide open when she would ask him
what was the matter with the potatoes that he
didn’t eat them, and he would retort, “Good
Lord, give me time—I can’t eat everything at
once, can I?”</p>

<p>At the office everybody began to notice
Mark’s speedometer wasn’t recording very reliably.
They also thought he was shifting into
Neutral a good deal for such a positive pussonality.
He would sometimes sit for 20 or 21 minutes
scratching his roof and looking at nothing
concrete. Then just when he would be verging
on the Mattewan Stare he would recover himself
sufficiently to bawl everybody out.</p>

<p>Things went on in this peaceful, happy
fashion at home and abroad until one day when
Mark suddenly decided to have a Thorough Understanding
with his Helpmeet. He pulled down
his vest and the cover of his desk, slapped his
granite derby on one Ear Hook, and pounded
heavily homeward for the Finals.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he opened the door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
little round-shouldered Apartment and called
hoarsely to his Mate. There was no answer.
Then he called again not quite so Arizona, but
Silence again responded. Mark heard the water
dripping in the kitchen sink. The little alarm
clock on a chair in Her bedroom ticked
like a steam riveter. One of Mark’s twenty-five
cent pure silk hose lay on the rocker where
She always sat. There was a needle and thread
still in the sock. Everything in the place seemed
kind of stiff and churchy—like a Scotch parlor
on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Mark hung around the middle of the floor
for a few moments and then flopped on the sofa
to think things over. It was boisterously
quiet. The chairs all stood around looking at
him like a lot of pall bearers waiting for the
sign to catch hold. A curtain moved slightly in
the breeze, and the rod of it tapped on the window
sill. It was a quiet little tap—kind of
uncanny, like a spirit rap.</p>

<p>“I’m beat,” said Mark, after a long pause,
packed with ache. “If she would only breeze
through that door right now, I’d chase pebbles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
up the beach all day long for her, or swim out
and fetch sticks.”</p>

<p>A thought struck him. He got up, put on
his o’rourke, and, closing the door ever so
lightly behind him, slipped over to the florist’s.
A moment later he returned with a great armful
of lilacs. He looked as if he had pinched them—there
were so many. Every vase in the house
he filled with them, and then stuck the balance
in empty milk bottles, pitchers, tin cans, and
back of the pictures.</p>

<p>“There!” he said, surveying the job, “that
will fix things up between us, and please her
when she returns.”</p>

<p>Then Mark went back to his office and worked
like a stoker.</p>

<p>That night when he returned home, the Right
One met him at the door.</p>

<p>“I wish you had not put those old lilacs all
over the place,” she opened up testily, “Just
look at that floor!”</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 17<br />

<small><span class="smcap">Two Business Baggers of Punkton</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a><br /><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>


<p class='drop-cap'>IN THE small burdock town of Punkton two
rival manufacturing plants wiggled for
supremacy.</p>

<p>The destinies of one were ably steered by a
veneered razorback named Grabit.</p>

<p>At the helm of the other stood one, Fairman
by name.</p>

<p>Grabit was a Pillar and had a pew right down
front, a little to windward.</p>

<p>He used to sit ample and contented every
Sunday morning listening to the little chinless
preacher extol his Sterling Virtues to the
blank-faced congregation.</p>

<p>Fairman wasn’t cutting any bold slashing
figure as a Pillar and he was the only man in
town who wasn’t wasting away worrying about
it.</p>

<p>The rest of the burg spent many anxious
hours speculating upon the probable location of
Fairman’s residential quarters in the Hereafter.</p>

<p>Grabit thought of his employes in terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
machinery and was a devoted husband and
father, according to custom.</p>

<p>Fairman called his men his “helpers” and
had the absurd notion that they were human.</p>

<p>In Grabit’s mind there was not so much as
a peewee doubt that he (i. e., Mr. Grabit) was
a very superior order of genius and that every
man under him was somewhere along about the
mollusk stage of unfoldment.</p>

<p>He felt that through Divine favor he was
enabled to grant to his men the blessed concession
of working 10 hours per diem for 8
hours payem. And he tucked his napkin under
his chin and was very grateful.</p>

<p>Fairman was so melon-brained that he
imagined his manufactured products to be the
result of the pooling of all the brains and activities
of all the men in his plant from the
General Manager down to the beetle that
pinched the perfectos from the top desk-drawer.</p>

<p>Grabit stroked his enameled brain-case and
reasoned that by paying his men more wages
they would only have that much more to
squander down at the Big Horn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>He figured that men of such muggy mentality
didn’t care to spend any time in their dull
homes, and so he couldn’t see any approximately
sane reason for shortening working
hours.</p>

<p>Fairman had the comical delusion that by
expanding wages and contracting the workday
he could cut off a lot of worry from the minds
of his laborers and their weary wives, and that
this in turn would mean increased bodily vigor,
clarity of thought, efficiency of action and other
things that would sound well if we could think
of them at this moment.</p>

<p>With the recklessness of Irresponsibility,
Fairman went so far as to put his spooly ideas
into effect. He paid a minimum wage so high
that when Grabit heard about it he let out a
roar that shook the apples all off the trees in
an orchard scene that his daughter, Eleanor,
had painted when she was at the Academy.</p>

<p>He swore that Fairman was demoralizing the
Labor Market and nervously pulled scotch hairs
out of his dilating nostrils.</p>

<p>Time tangoed on.</p>

<p>Visitors to the plant of Fairman began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
comment on the clear merry eyes of the
workers. The men went about their tasks with
speed and accuracy.</p>

<p>And whistled betimes.</p>

<p>And sang, maybe.</p>

<p>The factory’s output increased fifty percent
without straining a ligament. The puddler
seemed as interested as the President in everything
that was doing around the Works.</p>

<p>If you had stood on the corner when the
morning whistles blew, and watched the dinner-pailers
heading up Main Street, you could have
picked the workers of Fairman from the toilers
of Grabit with your eyes 22° off centre.</p>

<p>The Grabiters all had that “I wasn’t-hired-to-do-that”
air, and groused about the Boss in
low dismal tones all the way from liver-and-coffee
to forge and furnace, and back again.
Every shoulder balanced its chip; and grouch,
gruff and grump settled over the Works so thick
you couldn’t rip it with a rapier.</p>

<p>Every morning when Grabit opened his mail
he was regaled with much pleasing news from
Kicking Kusstomers about defective Goods,
shortage and all those things that wallow in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
wake of a system of inspection that has sagged
to a dull routine through indifference and the
lack of pussonel interest.</p>

<p>Grabit didn’t sneak behind any door and
whisper to himself what he really thought of
the unreasonable dubs that made these complaints.
On the contrary, he called his melancholy
stenographer and dictated a masterful
piece of satire and roofraising rhetoric that
was calculated to double them up like a jack-knife.</p>

<p>Now all this kind of thing was planked sirloin
for the Salesmen of Fairman. They shared in
the profits of their Concern and didn’t have to
knock down Bus Fares any more in their expense
books, and so they were full of joy and
jump.</p>

<p>They got after the disgruntled Customers of
Grabit like bees after blossoms and did not
exactly have to shoot up the place to scare any
of them away from their old connections.</p>

<p>Grabit’s Salesmen were drawing down their
good old $100 a month salary, and turning in
vouchers for street-car fares, and so when they
ran up against the Order Baggers of Fairman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
they were able to put up about as strong a
rebuttal as a girls’ debating society.</p>

<p>Each succeeding season saw a new addition
to the Fairman works, until forty acres had
been brought under roof and the town had been
made a regular stop for the Fast Express.
Grabit noted every progressive step with increasing
pains in the pit of the stomach, but
not to be outdone, he revolutionized things
himself by installing a new factory whistle.</p>

<p>Statements of the local banks showed steady
increases in the deposits of Fairman’s workers.
Neat little brick homes with phonographs in
the parlors sprouted all over the town and
made business good for the butcher, the baker,
and the electric light and power company.</p>

<p>Men with long hair and short hair and no
hair to speak of, came from far and near and
from Vedersburg, Indiana, to find out how
Fairman did it, and to get nose-close to the
system in actual operation.</p>

<p>Certain yard-stick philanthropists questioned
the Ultimate Good of it all, and there were many
sincere and hard-working Business Men clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
all the way from $1,000 to $5,000 a year in
their own business, who called Fairman “an
industrial accident” and believed down back
of their little cramped undershirts that such a
thing as an accidentally successful man could
actually be.</p>

<p>Recapitulation: Fairman became one slashing,
sensational success no matter how you
looked at the question—whether altruistically,
practically, or through a knot-hole.</p>

<p>As for Grabit, he sits today at his dusty little
desk, fingering his penny Ledger and absentmindedly
feeling around in his whiskers betimes
for a wild hair or two. Listlessly he turns the
ledger pages and counts the tombstones, and in
gloomy speculation asks himself why all those
old Customers went over to the Competish,</p>

<div class="verse">And his goods built on luck</div>
<div class="verse">Why his best men deserted</div>
<div class="verse">And the worst stuck—and struck.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>An echo answers “Why.”</p>

<p>The Office Cat, scrawny and sarcastic, jumps
on the window ledge. She gives Grabit one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
withering look, puts her thumb-equivalent to
her nose, and disappears into the night.</p>

<p>Grabit is alone.</p>

<p>Isn’t it harrowing though?</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>ONCE there was a ball-shaped mass of
matter whirling through space called
“The Earth.”</p>

<p>Compared to other masses of matter chasing
through the charted Universe, it was about as
big and important as a louse on the leg of an
elephant.</p>

<p>The Earth was covered with millions of
wiggling, jiggling, jumping little gnat-like
creatures called “Men.” These “Men” told
one another that they were the highest form of
created life.</p>

<p>And believed it.</p>

<p>And thought they had a sense of humor.</p>

<p>They made themselves a god in their own
image and likeness and kept altering and remodeling
him from epoch to epoch, to suit their
own selfish purposes. Their aim was to standardize
him so that everybody, whether white or
black or yellow or drab, could utilize him profitably
in his business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>For thousands of years these little shrimpy
Two Spots spent their time building up and
tearing down. As soon as one set of them would
start anything that promised to pull them out
of the inch-browed class and enable them to
stand on their hind legs and look upward, another
set would come along and push them back
on all fours again.</p>

<p>All of them were for Progress but none of
them knew what Progress meant. They all
stood for Morality, but as they had one Code of
Morals for one set and another Code for another
set and kept changing and shuffling these Codes
all the time none of them knew at any stage
of the game whether he was moral or immoral.
He had to read the Season’s Revised Rules before
he could tell.</p>

<p>In time certain foxy gazunks arose among
them called “rulers.” These rulers wore a lot
of bric-a-brac on their chests and catcher’s
masks on top of their heads called “crowns,”
and collected millions of Low Brows around
them and told the L. B.’s that God had selected
them to rule because they were wiser than anybody
else. The poor kanoops opened their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
heavy jaws and bulged out their eyes in glassy
awe, and believed it.</p>

<p>Each Ruler had his bright, beaming eye on
the other’s loafing-stool called the “throne,”
and manoeuvred merrily to pinch it. But he
was not always sure that his knee-bending subjects
would follow him and so he devised a
dandy little scheme.</p>

<p>He tore a piece off his royal shirt, painted
some hieroglyphics on it, and went out on the
balcony and told the assembled yappoos that
it was their “flag” and that they should always
fight for it and defend it, no matter whether
it was used to grab territory with, or to liberate
people who preferred not to be liberated.</p>

<p>At this, they all threw up their sweaty caps
and hoorayed until they were thick-throated
and bughouse.</p>

<p>But here and there in the bunch was a party
who had managed to wiggle out of the trough-stage
in spite of Civilization, and these came
forward and examined the “flag” and told the
crowd it was nothing but the tail of a shirt
waved for pilfering purposes. Whereupon these
inquisitive agnostics were promptly busted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the butcher’s hook with proper religious ceremonies.</p>

<p>Other Rulers hung out their long lawyer-like
necks to pipe the proceedings and found that
the flag was the best all-around little device
that had yet been framed for keeping the blobs
ignorant of the cold-unemotional fact that their
rulers were Con Men of keen calibre and their
claim to Divine Right of Rule just common,
ordinary, everyday Class C Shorthorn.</p>

<p>One day one of these rulers happened to turn
his head to the right to sneeze, and while he
wasn’t looking another ruler slipped over the
back of his throne, beckoned to his vassals to
follow, and sneaked up on his hands and knees
to pull the throne-stool from under the party
with the hay fever. Another Ruler, observing
the empty seat of his neighbor Divine Ruler,
started cross-lots to grab it.</p>

<p>But the first Ruler was a crafty little cuss
and when he saw this rearguard action, he and
his followers turned around and a mighty, murderous
mix-up ensued.</p>

<p>With a Green Eye on Gain, the other Rulers
then buckled on their war boots and galloped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
into the muck to help the respective pugs and
at the same time help themselves to anything
lying around uncrated.</p>

<p>When they all got thoroughly started, Hell
closed its doors and went out of business on
account of the competition.</p>

<p>Each Ruler realizing that he himself
couldn’t fight for fried fish, began to shake his
little mad-made god before the eyes of the
Deluded, and through poetry, prose and prayer
got them to believe that it was deity’s own
special wish that he should slaughter his neighbor.
This worked like a kaffir charm and all
hands went to the slaughter with a smile that
reached from ear to ear and clear around to
the back of the neck.</p>

<p>Every time a certain Divine Righter landed
a good old jaw-breaker on the enemy he would
say that it was god’s coaching that did it, and
every time he got one in the abdominal area
that doubled him up like a folding-bed, he
would shake his finger at the victor and splutter
out, “You wait! God will punish you yet!”
They all had the very same god working for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
them and beseeched him to come down and
wallow with them.</p>

<p>When the rough-house had progressed long
enough to lay them all out squirming and moaning
and praying like a lot of winded dervishes,
the great God of Eternity—the God that forged
the Universe of Universes and set countless
worlds a’whirring in one grand harmony of
Love and Service—leaned over the balcony of
Heaven, and with the back of His mighty hand
swept them all off the dinky, ball-shaped mass
of matter like ants from a table top.</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 19<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Passing of the Buck Passers</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a><br /><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was a man of Pep and Potential
who owned a large and constantly
stretching Business.</p>

<p>Originally it was the size of a pants button
and consisted of one ratty Rolltop, two rubber-stamps
and a nominal assortment of liabilities.</p>

<p>National Advertising had dredged the Business
out of the dump of Dinkyism and tossed it
upon the apex of Affluence.</p>

<p>The sudden and unexpected growth had sunk
the Boss ear-deep in detail drudgery, and so he
decided to surround himself with men who could
balance some of the burden that rested upon
his convex shoulders and caused forehead-furrows
like a first-line trench.</p>

<p>Thereupon he hired for his Sales Manager a
calm and collected caterpillar who had been doing
high-class dental work at a leading Way
Station and acting as professional pallbearer
on off-days. Caterpill came Highly Recommended
by a frowsy friend connected with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Advertising Agency that was hoeing in 15 per
cent on all business placed.</p>

<p>The Boss next decided to graft onto the main
trunk an expert Advertising Manager, and so
he selected from the 70,000 agitated applicants
a complacent party that knew as much about
Advertising as a first-class dragoman.</p>

<p>Then said Doc Boss to himself, said he: Now
that I have the Sales and Advertising ends of
the works hemmed up, I must get me somebody
with brains and ballast to do my buying; also
a hot hound to superintend the plant and a
sprightly spaniel to see that the stuff gets
shipped during the same historical epoch in
which orders are received.</p>

<p>So he sniffed about the town and soon had
these pearly positions filled with a couple of
polliwogs related to his wife’s uncle and his
cousin’s chums, and they brought their letters
of Hearty endorsement from the Pastor and
the red-horned Congressman of the District.</p>

<p>Having surrounded himself with the afore
enumerated eminent executives, Comrade Boss
leaned back in his revolving Reposer and said:
“At last I am going to cop a wee round of rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and recreation. No more work, worry, and
wiscissitude for me.”</p>

<p>The last syllable had slid gracefully away on
the serene, sweet morning air when the new
Superintendent greased in to find out if there
would be any objection to his putting a new
hinge on the factory door.</p>

<p>On his way out, the Supe bumped into the
Sales Manager on his way in to ask Governor
Boss if he should go ahead and O. K. an Expense
Account upon whose fair bosom rested
a Bus Fare charge at Holbrook Hollow where
the hotel leans leisurely up against the railroad
station.</p>

<p>Mayor-general Boss smiled sweetly, said
“No” (dam you) and turned away to wrestle
with a few speckled doubts that began to creep
up into his Thinkery and nibble at his Composure.</p>

<p>Before he had bottled his irritabiliousness,
in flowed the serene Advertising Manager wanting
to know whether he should change the copy
in the Ads every decade or so, or let it stand
until it fell down from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>When this genius of initiative had ebbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
away, the Boss’s telephone she rang and he
grabbed at the instrument like a straw grabs
at a drowning man, thinking that some diversion
in way of a date might be in prospect.</p>

<p>But he found it was the new Buyer wanting
to know which of two quotations he should
accept—the higher or the lower. Professor
Boss replied that it was a knotty case to decide
off-palm, but from a superficial cast-over there
might be no grievous mistake in accepting the
lower quotation; and the Buyer naturally said
he thought the same way but didn’t feel justified
in taking the responsibility of deciding all alone
by hisself.</p>

<p>When Uncle Boss had hung up the receiver
he found the bright-eyed Shipping Clerk standing
at his tired side waiting to be wisdomed-up
on whether he should ship 34,999 lbs. at the
L. C. L. rate or pay for the extra lb. and get the
C. L. rate.</p>

<p>Major Boss thought a long time but not about
what the Shipping Clerkerino had whispered.
He was just trying to make a choice between
murder and suicide. He decided to do neither,
but to just hold onto his Patience as a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
self-discipline and try to get in his rest between
Foolish Quesions.</p>

<p>For the first six months he seemed to be
making considerable prog., often getting several
moments to himself, during which aforesaid
moments he fumbled with his cufflinkers
and pulled his eyebrows to see if he could get
one out at every pull.</p>

<p>But when the calendar year had begun to
run down at the heel, the demands from the
Department Heads became so insistent and insupperable
that one day Cap Boss jumped up on
his desk, gave one blood icing yell, swung his
arms wildly in the crisp autumn ozone, and dove
head-on into the cuspidor.</p>

<p>When he had been fished out and revived, he
seemed strangely calm and collected. In a voice
that had a weird, far-away-over-the-hills sound,
but carrying in its depths an unmistakable quality
of determination, he called in all his hefty,
high-class helpers, told them to be seated, and
spake as hereinafter recorded, to wit and to-wot:</p>

<p>“When I engaged you muskrats I had a feeling
that this Business was slightly pied. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
thought you could do the Necessary, and use
such commonsense as you perhaps happened to
have, in order to push the Enterprise to the
pinnacle of Power.</p>

<p>“I now find that not a rum of you has the
initiative of a set of false whiskers nor the
judgment of a jelly-bean. As Buck Passers
you’ve got everything this side of Congress
pummeled to a pulp, and when it comes to stalling,
you are all Class A-Super and no mistake.</p>

<p>“You will therefore please take a long jump
into the jungles of Oblivion, and, as a little
souvenir of my regard, I propose to present
each man on his way out with a swift kick in the
Kupps.”</p>

<p>When the last kanoop had cleared, Commodore
Boss got a new outfit consisting of non-relatived
men of EXPERIENCE and while the
thought of the high salaries he had to pay them
made him swallow like a cock eating corn-meal,
he got over it when he found he could get off
every afternoon for 18 holes and fish for a fortnight
without fretting a fret.</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 20<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Executive With The Clerk’s Mind</span></small></h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a><br /><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>


<p class='drop-cap'>A &nbsp;ONE-LEGGED manufactory had a little
round office boy.</p>

<p>He used to go down to the Post Office
every morning on his roller skates and fetch up
the mail in a leather sack.</p>

<p>We forget the exact dimensions of the sack,
but the story can go on without them until such
time as we may be able to call them up.</p>

<p>This office boy was a good office boy and did
not carve his initials in his father’s wooden leg,
nor hang around the streets watching a safe
moving in.</p>

<p>The manufactory in which he hopped about
and drew his Dollar and a Quarter a week, was
not so big as Standard Oil, but it had a side-track
and a time-clock and involved the activities
of seventy-five men, two of which were old
women—the Sales &amp; Advertising Manager and
the Proprietor.</p>

<p>Time scuffled on, and the War came, and with
it came some new business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the Proprietor and the Sales
Manager were a little sore around the heart
at this intrusion upon their days of peace
and quiet, spent largely in cutting up old envelopes
for scratch paper.</p>

<p>But gradually they got used to the upset and
flurry, and when the monthly Balance Sheet
began to smile and then to grin, it poked their
Ambition in the ribs and the first thing they
knew they were actually craning their shaved
necks for business in the Domestic as well as
in the Export arena.</p>

<p>Men think they push their own business to
greatness, but they don’t. Nine out of ten have
greatness thrust upon them by national advertising,
but you never hear of them chasing the
Agency that did it up the boulevard trying to
catch and laurel it for pulling them out of the
puddle of commercial provincialism.</p>

<p>Here let us state in calm, well modulated
tones that we are not forgetting about the
office boy, around whose life this little narrative
is written, or wrotten. We are letting him alone
until he grows into manhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The office boy is now grown and so is the
business.</p>

<p>The boy is Alfred William Clerkmind, and
he is the President of the whole outfit.</p>

<p>The old proprietor has long since been
mounded and marked, and the Sales &amp; Advertising
Manager, of whom we spoke of, or rather,
about whom we spoke about, is still reading
Printers Ink and learning how they put it over.</p>

<p>Alfred William Clerkmind has been so busy
growing up with the business that he has never
had time to travel any farther from home than
the one-lunged Country Club for nine holes on
a Sunday morning.</p>

<p>His reading has been confined to his Trade
Magazine, his home town daily, and his competitors’
catalogues.</p>

<p>The people he has met socially are the same
earspreaders he used to know as boys and girls
in the days when he was juggling up the mail
in the leather sack, size 24″ x 36″.</p>

<p>The men he has met in a business way, all
have come down to the bowlegged burg to sell
him something, and so he has always had eager
listeners whenever he talked from the chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
out; so he has been denied the golden privilege
of having men tell him to his cone-shaped face
just what they thought of him and his Ideas.</p>

<p>In other phraseology, Alfred William Clerkmind,
executive, is Alfred William Clerkmind,
office boy, with different scenery. His arms and
legs are longer, his body thicker, his head fatter
than when he licked stamps, but his psychology
and general outlook are the same.</p>

<p>He tells his New York Salesman that one can
live for four dollars a week at the best boarding
house in Skunkton with Neapolitan ice
cream every Sunday, and therefore any man
should be able to do the same in New York—or
do better, because there’s a bigger choice in
Noo Yoark.</p>

<p>Every time it comes to changing copy in the
ads, they have to throw him and blindfold him
to keep him from re-writing it himself and
running in a lot of snappy, pungent stuff of the
come-one-come-all, we-strive-to-please variety.</p>

<p>Alfred William doesn’t understand why a
salesman should ride in a Pullman any more
than why the Trade shouldn’t wiggle up on its
abdomen and beg for the Goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>And since he has not the time to travel, nor
read, nor meet people who do, he has no way
of getting at the facts of business.</p>

<p>He feels that he must personally ooze into
every part of the works at all times. And, as
a consequence, none of the department heads
cares to assume the responsibility of sealing an
envelope without getting Alfie’s “O. K.”</p>

<p>Sometimes Alfie tries to be a good fellow, and
thereupon he slaps somebody a wooden slap
on the back. But there’s something in his playfulness
that makes the recip. feel like turning
around and spreading his resentment all over
Alfie’s respectable features.</p>

<p>When anybody is relating a humorsome narrative,
Alfie sets a certain time and place to
laugh regardless of the development of the
story, and then there’s no telling how long the
rafters are going to hold out. Then just as
suddenly he gets back into his coffin and pulls
down the lid.</p>

<p>At such times Alfie’s voice has about as much
merriment in it as a sack of dried apples, but
whenever he decides to burst forth, all the
little office gnats have got to laugh too, for fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
they will lose their Fifty Dollar jobs if they
don’t.</p>

<p>Emerson says that every institution is the
lengthened shadow of the kanoop that started
it, and we are not mentioning this just to show
how clubby we are with Ralph’s sayings, but to
clear up any outstanding doubt that the institution
of which Alfred William Clerkmind is
the head and front, and coat, pants and collar-button,
reflects in every detail the spirit of the
big, broad, ruddycheeked Captain of Industry
that steers it.</p>

<p>An idea might walk into that Works and hang
around for six months, and not a man in the
whole outfit would invite it to come in and sit
down.</p>

<p>The most important business of the week that
any of the inmates has on his mind is how to
get the shirt back from the Chinaman’s in time
for the Saturday night dance at the Commercial
Ath-a-letic Club.</p>

<p>We started this story with the intention of
showing how Alfred William Clerkmind finally
made a trip to Kankakee and broadened out.
But he can’t seem to make up his mind which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
train he will take, and in the meantime the
space alloted to us for this story has run out.</p>

<p>So we can only say in closing that no business
can expect to wax international when the Chief
Executive is carrying around with him the same
cow-licked sky-piece that he used when he was
bowlegging up the street with the morning’s
mail in a sack.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>HE WAS paunchy and broad-beamed and
looked like one of Artist Young’s
skippers of industry.</p>

<p>The top of his dome was mercerized but there
was a sturdy little hedge of auburn stubble
running west of a line drawn parallel with the
top of his right listener.</p>

<p>This served as a dam to catch the honest
perspiration from running down on his Henry
Clay collar.</p>

<p>It also gave him something semi-tangible to
comb in the mornings.</p>

<p>His full-orbed jowls were decorated with
auburn fenders, parted in the middle and
severely orthodox in their general behavior.</p>

<p>Naturally, with this trimming, he was long
on civic righteousness, religious rallies and
other pillar activities.</p>

<p>He was one of those opulent American industrial
successes that point with their thumbs,
believe that woman’s place is the home, and go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
in and out of an elevator square across, regardless
of wedged-in humanity.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most dominant of his virtues
was his high-pressure patriotism. When it
came to patriotic oratory he had Patrick Henry
looking like a gaping neutral.</p>

<p>It was only logical, therefore, that he should
have become a most fearless and forensic advocate
of Preparedness as soon as the word was
coined. And he did become that same, as hereinbefore
itemized.</p>

<p>In 1916, when California decided to elect
President Wilson, this popular pusher for
Preparedness was wild with indignation, and
tore out his luxurious side whiskers by the fistful,
and jumped up and down on his little
malleable derby.</p>

<p>Everyone with whom he came in contact was
assured by him that the country was heading for
helldom on high.</p>

<p>It also gave him a bit of relief to vent his
vituperation on Comrade President for not
rushing into War on the day that Kaiser Bill
began to shoot up the high seas like a bar
braggart on a busy Saturday night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost any hour you passed his office you
could hear him over the transom telling somebody
about the folly of Watchful Waiting, conciliatory
notes and other presidential piffle.</p>

<p>He said that nothing could be nobler than for
young Americans to offer up their lives in
defense of flag and country.</p>

<p>And just to show how doggone deep his
Nationalism went, he trotted out and bought a
great big American flag for cash and nailed it
up back of his desk.</p>

<p>When Uncle Sam finally decided to throw
the little felt kelly into the international ring,
he turned back the lapel of his coat and threw
out his patriotic chest as if he had scored some
big personal victory against the determined
resistance of a hundred million Americans.</p>

<p>One day, shortly after the events of which we
speak, our War Hero was found sitting at his
Mahogany, with knitted brows and knotted
physiog, steeped in painful, ponderous thought.</p>

<p>Nobody knew just what had struck him until
he called his stenographer and dictated a very
private but trenchant letter to the Congressman
of his District and another to his favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Senator with the wooden Prince Al, adjuring
them to fight against the clause in the War Tax
Bill that threatened to assail his profits.</p>

<p>Having landed a munitions contract in the
early days of the war that netted him a cold,
clammy four million in profits, and having
drawn a beautiful mental picture of just how
he was going to invest that million so as to
bring a modest return of 100 percent, he was
naturally given over to the ravages of righteous
indig when he learned that the Government
proposed to put its large horny fist into his
profit bag and extract a fairly girthful percentage
of those profits for use in helping clothe
and feed the young Americans whom he so
highly honored for their Patriotism.</p>

<p>Also he went up in the air ’way beyond anti-aircraft
range when he found that the draft
bill contemplated calling into active service
young men between the ages of 20 and 30.</p>

<p>He loudly proclaimed it a ridiculous and preposterous
piece of flumdubble to call upon such
young men when every sane man knew that the
Flower of American virility was between the
ages of 31 and 41.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>His son was 24 and he was 54.</p>

<p>When the first Liberty Bond issue was floated
he got sort of backed into an uncomfortable
corner and spent several tortuous nights and
difficult days wondering how he was going to
hurdle this issue without barking his patriotic
shins.</p>

<p>At last, after looking up Uncle Sam in
Bradstreets, and convincing himself that Uncle
S. would not go bust right away, he made up his
mind to plunge, irrespective of his own future
comfort.</p>

<p>So he went down to his bank and bought a nice
One Hundred Dollar Bond which he offered to
sell to any of his employes who might not have
a chance to get to the polls before they closed.</p>

<p>The next day he took steps to have his son
exempted from the draft on the grounds that he
was the sole support of his motor car—but of
course assured the Board of the young patriot’s
eagerness to trek for the trenches.</p>

<p>He also stopped long enough in his work of
figuring out a 100% increase in the selling price
of his wares to get an assortment of little allied
flags and stick them on the hood of his Packard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition, he bought a Red Cross button and
put it in the aperature of his coat lapel.</p>

<p>Further, he allowed one of his clerks to spend
several hours on the Firm’s time to collect a
fund for the Red Cross from the other employes,
and he himself led off the list with a
Dollar which nobody had the nerve to collect
from him after he wrote down his influential
name.</p>

<p>In fact, patriotism and practical helpfulness
to the Nation ran rampant through his whole
family.</p>

<p>His wife started to knit an army sweater at
the outbreak of the War, and as we go to press
she is still knitting it. She has got as far as
casting off the neck.</p>

<p>His daughter also started in energetically to
make Red Cross bandages, and every week or
so she went down to Headquarters for an hour
to get in out of the cold while waiting for some
friend for tea.</p>

<p>When final victory perched upon the banner
of the Allied Cause and The Boys came
dragging home to a jobless civic life, this patriotic
pillar of Preparedness whose unselfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
service to his country in time of national need
had so greatly lightened the nation’s burden,
threw the whole tonnage of his influence against
The Soldiers’ Bonus Bill and other Paternalistic
Notions, declaring them pernicious
and Economically Unsound.</p>

<p>He also wrote a book entitled “How We Won
The War” and dedicated it to his son and
daughter.</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 22<br />

<small><span class="smcap">Typical American and Critical American</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a><br /><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was once a comfortable piece of
suet who considered himself a Typical
American and oozed oleaginous sentiments
of Lofty Patriotism through a three-dimensional
Mid Western brogue every time he
saw a good opening.</p>

<p>He loved America so much that he used to
spend six months out of every year Abroad with
his big cigars and his fat wife. He liked to get
up on a barrel in every port he backed into,
and tell the natives a few things about Our
great liberty-loving America where every man
was free to spit on the sidewalk if he wanted
to.</p>

<p>He took a Keen Delight in roasting everything
that was non-American and making himself
miserable every time he turned a foreign
corner. He used to grease down three 18-inch
collars every day pointing out to his billow-chinned
Helpmeet how senseless These Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Foreigners were for doing things this way instead
of doing them that way. Any time he
overlooked anything for condemnation, the
Little One (Ton) would heave-to and remind
him of it in a whistling nasaletto that made you
instinctively hang onto your hat.</p>

<p>From two to four hours were put in each day
of the calender month grousing about the cold
rooms, cold hotels, cold shops, cold theatres,
cold everything. It made them both hot to think
of the cold. During these protest meetings,
Typical American would tread the floor heavily
and work his cigar angrysomely from one
side of his gasser to the other and then back
again, and take a solemn oath before his Maker
that if he ever got back home without cracking
he would turn on the steam-heat until the walls
began to run like sap.</p>

<p>Another thing that always added to the merriment
of their foreign philandering was the
Customs. Every time an inspector requested
Typ. Am. or his Better Half Ton to open up a
piece of luggage, Typ would bring down upon
the inquisitive little inspectorial head a torrent
of biting injective that would have made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
crawl under the culvert in shame had it been
able to get next to the linguistic delivery.</p>

<p>For the inconveniences and jarring out-of-dateness
of Foreign Travel were but a mild
rash when it came to the question of power to
annoy. It was the systematic pillaging of Typ
and Mrs. Typ that proved to be the big aching
carbuncle.</p>

<p>Every time Typ went to pay a taxi fare, they
tried to flam him out of two or three cents and
he used to have to use up about seven dollars’
worth of American energy arguing the hold-up
with the robber at the wheel and trying to prove
to him in excited expletives that the legal Scale
of Rates showed 20 cents for two miles instead
of 22 cents.</p>

<p>When Typ would register at a hotel he
always had to get into the ring for ten rounds
with the Swiss Cheese in the long prince albert
before he could get anything like the rate and
the room he wanted. What he didn’t tell the
Concierge down stairs about his old hotel he
would tell the porters up stairs when they were
juggling in the baggage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Typ would be examining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
curtains and things, and giving the pirates a
piece of her mind for charging Four Dollars a
day for one double room and bath when they
should have had the whole floor for that price.</p>

<p>Typ got chronic indigestion from scrapping
over the price of his dejeuner, and Mrs. Typ
swore regularly every morning that she’d see
the buccaneers in the sixteenth sub-basement of
Gehenna before she’d pay 18 cents for two
measley boiled eggs—then she’d go ahead and
order them.</p>

<p>Their daily sight-seeing and shopping excursions
in all foreign countries were continually
marred by the petty pilferings and short-change
manoeuvering of foreign highbinders, and many
a night as they sat fingering their finances in
the hotel lobby and adding up how much they
had squandered during the day, they would discover
where they had been bilked of anywhere
from seventy-five cents to one dollarr and a
quarterrrrrr besides finding among their small
change a worthless Portuguese coin that some
low-down dragoman had handed them instead
of a piastre.</p>

<p>When Typ and Mrs. Typ returned to America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
at the end of the year fagged to a frazzle and
pining for just one peep at the Land of the
Free and the home of the Oil Trust, their joy
knew no anchor. They could hardly wait for
their ship to bring them in sight of the Lady of
Liberty and they pedaled the deck like jailed
jaguars and Typ smoked cigar after cigar and
spit over the deck-rail in wild abandon.</p>

<p>At last they arrived at New York and were so
anxious to set feet on terry firmy that their
eagerness carried them down the gang-plank
before the Veterinary had come Aboard, and
so they ran up against a Minion of the Law
who gave them a call that reverberated for
miles along the Palisades and made the Goddess
of Liberty almost spill her torch. Whereupon
they both got crimson back of their large ears
and apologized profusely and stepped all over
each other getting back into line where they
crouched for seven hours without moving a
muscle of the map.</p>

<p>Before the day was wholly gone, they were
permitted to go into the Customs House, and
the Inspector told them to open all baggage,
and they said Yessir and got busy with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
keys, and for the next hour-and-a-half were
bowing and bending over 18 boxes and bags,
and pulling things apart and trying their very
doggondest to prove that they were on the
level.</p>

<p>When they had at last begun to feel that they
had proved their innocence, the Inspector, with
his arm dug shoulder-deep in the last of the
trunks, fished up a pill-box and all bets were off
again until he had opened it and shaken the
pills out and run his finger-nail around the
crevices and turned it upside down and inside
out, and put it to his ear and smelled it and
trained an X-Ray machine on it, and then declared
everything was all right and they could
depart in peace.</p>

<p>Thanking the Inspector for his interest, and
with a sigh of relief that was full of humility
and unshed tears, they got a couple of porters
to wheel their stuff out to a Taxi, and in the
fullness of a swift joy that came upon them
when they got outside and sniffed the free
American winter air, they gave the two portering
gentlemen a crisp dollar bill for the service.</p>

<p>Whereupon the gentlemen looked at the bill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
like it was some kind of curiosity, then looked
at each other and groaned, and then gave the
givers a look that scared them to a pope’s
purple and made them finger further with the
purse-string until the gentlemen had grunted
their approval and departed.</p>

<p>When they arrived at their hotel they found
they had only a couple of hundred dollars to
pay the taxi fare with, but they managed to get
by with it without inciting any murderous
thought in the breast of the driver, and went in
and registered.</p>

<p>When they informed the Room Clerk that
they had not made any reservations he said
he was sorry but everything was taken except
one room without bath adjoining the boiler-house
which was being held for a certain
gentleman who had wired for it several months
ago. Then King Klerk tapped his fingers on the
desk and looked boredly out beyond their square
heads and repeated that he was sorry.</p>

<p>At this, Mr. and Mrs. Typ got down on their
knees and said the Litany, and the room clerk
thawed and told them they could have the room
for $20 a day if they barked quick. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
barked. They also thanked him from the bottom
of their grateful American hearts and told
him whenever he came to their town to look
them up.</p>

<p>When they had squeezed into their little ingrowing
room they found that it had only one
window, and that was an opening in the ceiling
about the size of a silver dollar, but fifty times
the value. They also found the porters hanging
around for a tip and forgot that it was the
custom at home to fee the beetles a quarter
every time they did something instead of giving
the whole bunch a couple of shillings at the
end of a week’s work. They apologized for this
oversight and then settled down for a little rest.</p>

<p>The temperature of the room was between
300 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit and Mr. Typ
began to sweat like a brewery horse and got
up to pull off his coat, but found the room was
too cramped to do it and so he took off his
necktie instead.</p>

<p>About the time that their eyes were beginning
to hang out on their cheek-bones with the
heat, and their ears were ringing like a Broadway
New Year’s eve celebration, they managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to throw off the approaching comatose and back
out of the room and down to the restaurant for
lunch.</p>

<p>The head waiter said all the tables were full
but if they didn’t mind sitting outside for a
couple of weeks he would see what he could do.
They said “Oh-that’s-all-right” and thanked
him very kindly and gave him a Dollar Bill and
sat down outside the door and tried to look as
if they didn’t mind it at all. They didn’t want
to give the Head Waiter the slightest suspicion
that they were inconvenienced and run the risk
of his getting sore at them and shutting them
off altogether from the privilege of eating in
the restaurant which he didn’t own.</p>

<p>During the same epoch they managed to get
a little table facing the wall and a pillar, and
were soon rummaging through the Feed Folder
for some dish that they could afford to buy
without becoming insolvent. They finally took
refuge in the haven of all who don’t know what
they want, and after they had eaten the last
scrap of the roast beef they quietly paid the
eleven-dollar check and went out to find the
bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day they took a train for their home,
and were so accustomed to foreign compartment
cars that they decided to get a compartment.
But when they found out the price, they
concluded to buy a motor car instead and compromised
on a berth in the main dormitory.
There were no lowers to be had, and so they
thanked the Pullman Conductor and took an
upper.</p>

<p>The car seemed a trifle like a dry-kiln in
temperature and they asked the porter if he
would mind introducing a little outside atmosphere.
He looked at the thermomenter and
said it was only 190 degrees in the car and that
the rules of the company forbade him from
opening any more air-holes unless it got up to
3,000 degrees. They thanked the porter for the
trouble they had caused him and asked him
how all the folks were and bade him good-night
and crawled up the ladder and disappeared
back of the curtains, and were soon wrapped in
the arms of Morph.</p>

<p>A week after they had arrived home, and had
told everybody how glad they were to get back
to God’s Country, the Cost of living began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
show unusual agility in the high jump. The
trial heats had caused people to gasp, but when
the finals came on, everybody became highly
excited and ran to and fro wondering what was
coming next in way of sensation.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Typical American, with their
originality of brain convolutions, decided that
the only reasonable thing to do was to teach
the people how to starve. And so they organized
a Gradual Starvation Class and secured
many other Typical Americans as pupils and
thanked God that through his bounty, the
people did not have to do the job suddenly, but
could dwindle away slowly and almost painlessly.</p>

<p>They were getting on Very Well until a certain
few Americans—not in any sense typical—came
out in the open here and there, and
said: “Not by a damsight! With grainaries
groaning with unused grain, with eggs piled
Babel-high in gigantic warehouses, with cotton
enough in one State to clothe the whole Nation
in summer, and wool enough on the backs of
one-tenth of the sheep of the country to clothe
the whole Nation in winter, with banks bursting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
with gold and freight cars enough to move
the wares of the planet when not cornered in
the holy cause of Pillage—not by a damsight
will America starve herself to make a few Rich
richer!”</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that these voices
crying in the wilderness jarred loose in time
the sluggish national contentment of Mr. and
Mrs. Typ and other Americans everywhere,
and made them think.</p>

<p>But just when they began to think, it was time
for them to go Abroad again.</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 23<br />

<small><span class="smcap">When Mental Leech Meets Mental Leech</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a><br /><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was a temperamental manufacturer
who used to come down to the
office after a thick night in the Loop and
unleash a long low growl about the lack of
Initiative among his men.</p>

<p>“There isn’t a kanoop among them,” he said,
“that has the originality of a tadpole.”</p>

<p>On a certain day, not unlike any other day
in this particular establishment, the Sales
Manager poked his nose gradually into the
Boss’s office, and, sniffing the Boss within,
squeezed cautiously into the room, scraping the
nap all off his courage as he did so.</p>

<p>“Will you please be so kind as to tell me,”
whispered the Sales Manager, “if this little
ginger-up letter to the Road Rats meets your
approval?”</p>

<p>The Boss grabbed the letter, shot a lightning
glance at it upside-down, and rammed it back
into the Sales Manager’s hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rotten!” he said, “Lacks originality—pep!
No punch in it!”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the Sales Manager
mildly. “I’ll see if I can not embody some of
the points of your constructive criticism.” And
he oozed out of the room again.</p>

<p>In came the Advertising Manager, walking
on his ankles so as to not make any riotous disturbance.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking—” he began.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” sneered His Gentle Bosslets,
putting his heels up on his glass-topped desk
and lighting his eighty-seventh cigarette since
breakfast.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking,” continued the Adv.
Mgr. affecting to ignore the suggestion but failing
miserably from the knees down, “I was
just thinking that maybe it might not be a bad
plan, perhaps, to paint New York next month,
please.”</p>

<p>“NEVER!” roared the Boss. “Never in a
thousand years. The painted bulletin is no
good—never was. Poster’s the thing! I’d
rather post New York for one month than paint
it for forty years at half the price.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very good, then—shall I go in for that?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life. I’ve just decided on a
newspaper campaign.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Adv. Mgr., backing
out of the room and falling over a few chairs
and things on the fairway.</p>

<p>When the intruder had vanished, Commander
Boss got up, ran his long temperamental digits
through his top-fringe and pounded out into
the manufacturing department where he proceeded
to raise from fourteen to sixteen separate
and distinct kinds of scarlet hell for the general
lack of initiative and commonsense around
his plant.</p>

<p>Things went on in this happy homelike fashion
until one fine warm Spring day when Brigadier
Boss up and booted the whole bunch of
bungling department heads into the great Out
of Doors and set about to effect a re-organization.</p>

<p>“What I want is men who do THEIR OWN
thinking,” he said, and he began telephoning
and writing and wiring and advertising all over
the country for A-1 Initiativers.</p>

<p>In due time he got them and called them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
into his office and passed the cigars and explained
how he wanted each man to run his own
Department just as if it was his own business,
exercising merely ordinary judgment and
commonsense.</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell them how the old
herd had always passed the old buck to him,
never doing anything unless they were told,
fearing even to set down the total of a column
of figures without first consulting him, and he
wound up with a few Well Chosen remarks
about Co-operation and Co-ordination and the
old reliable shoulder-to-the-wheel stuff.</p>

<p>Everybody was happy and talky and full of
pep and chest-out chatter, for be it remembered
that each new Department Head was an
Individual and not a Person, and could hold his
own with the best bullers of bulldom.</p>

<p>And so they all adjourned to their respective
stalls and started in their new work with enthusiasm,
energy and enterprise, and any other
snapful word that you could think of beginning
with “e.”</p>

<p>Things went great and glorious for about a
month when the Boss discovered that the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Superintendent had put in a lot of machinery
in the manufacturing department that he did
not approve of, and he proceeded to give the
Supe a double-nutted Call Down that carried
to Columbus, Ohio.</p>

<p>The Supe came back not unstrengthfully
whereupon the Boss’s eyes flashed like a
Zeppelin night-searcher, and the Supe remembering
that he had seventeen children and a
motorcycle to support, cooled down almost to
a solid, and let the Boss rave on like a knight
of Montana overcharged by a cabman.</p>

<p>Shortly after this explosion in the factory
the Boss happened into the Sales Manager’s
throbbing little office, and in the course of a
high-spirited but not dangerous discussion on
things in general he discovered that the S. M.
had re-districted the whole territory and
changed agencies right and left and down the
middle.</p>

<p>Whereupon Major General Boss let out a
roar that shook the business mottoes from the
walls and sent the stenographer scurrying to
the south gate. Everything he could think of
off-hand he called the Sales Manager, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
proceeded to look up a few choice ones in the
Dock Hands’ Ready Vocabulary.</p>

<p>At this, the Sales Manager doubled his fists
and closed his eyes to an ominous squint, and
was all ready to spring—when he happened
to think of the monthly installment on his
Victrola, and so he dropped into his chair and
sat numb and dumb, and then some.</p>

<p>On his way out, the Boss chanced to see the
Advertising Manager pouring over a dummy
on his desk.</p>

<p>“What’s that bum thing?” growled Doc
Boss, pointing his long presidential finger
toward the busy little desk.</p>

<p>“Why that’s the layout for a broadside that
I’m mailing to the Dealer Trade on our new
No. 7’s,” replied the Advertising Manager,
smiling.</p>

<p>“No good—no good in the world!” came
back Uncle Boss. “Nobody on earth would stop
to read that thing. Too big—too unwieldy—copy
too scattered—weak copy, too—might
just as well mail out a sheet of white paper! A
clumsy folder like that, gets in with the second-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
matter and goes the route of the wastebasket.
Nothing to it!”</p>

<p>“What you want,” continued the Boss, rising
in temperature, “is a snappy little envelope
insert like this—” And he grabbed up a small
piece of paper and folded it angrily and shook
it before the surprised eyes of the new Adv.
Mgr.</p>

<p>Whereupon, without waiting for further
reasoning or retort, Captain Boss withdrew,
leaving the puzzled Adv. Mgr. to ponder over
the punk suggestion. “Perhaps he’s right after
all,” he reflected.</p>

<p>A few days later Colonel Boss wandered into
the Advertising Manager’s office again.</p>

<p>“What’s this dinky little thing?” he inquired,
picking up a dummy that the Adv. Mgr. had on
his desk.</p>

<p>“Why that’s just a little insert I’m getting
ready to send out to the Dealer Trade on our
new No. 7’s.”</p>

<p>“Holy Smoke!” ejaculated Commodore
Boss, “how do you expect us to get by with our
No. 7’s on that measley little thing. What you
want is a smashing broadside—something big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
enough for a fellow to see without impairing
his eyesight—something that will command
attention—something that will—”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” broke in the Adv. Mgr., rising
from his warm chair and looking kind of doggone
determined. “Last week I had a broadside
underway and you came in here and
ordered it off, and said you wanted an insert.
You now come in and rap the insert and say you
want a broadside.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hell,” cut in Premier Boss, “don’t pay
any attention to what I say.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to,” flashed back the now
thoroughly aroused Adv. Mgr., “but YOU are
going to pay attention to what I say, and you’re
going to remember it the longest day you live.”</p>

<p>“When I came here,” he continued, sticking
his fist right up close to the Boss’s olfactory
knob, “you told me that your old organization
was a bunch of dummies and said you wanted
initiative. You SAID it, but you did not MEAN
it. <i>You</i> don’t want initiative and independent
thinking. You want weakness and sycophancy.</p>

<p>“You could not stand a strong mind in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
establishment six months. There would be a
constant clash for mental supremacy. THE
OLD MEN THAT YOU CANNED ALL HAD
WILL POWER OF THEIR OWN ONCE. But
you sapped their wills to feed your own rotten
gourmand Will. And when they had no more
mental pap to give you, you despised them.
You despised them for lack of the very thing
you robbed them of.</p>

<p>“You are a Mental Leech—the most dangerous
class of citizen in the world. And when it
so happens that your stripe is an employer,
your sin is doubly damnable because the mental
resistance of the average employe is weakened
against your onslaught through the fear he has
of losing his job.</p>

<p>“I’ll concede that you have never before been
CONSCIOUS of what you were doing,” roared
the Adv. Mgr, “but from this moment you
<i>shall</i> be conscious of it, and of your responsibility
if you dare ever again to use it—you
big blustering mental bully you!”</p>

<p>“You’re fired,” interrupted the Boss in a
flannel voice and plainly whipped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“I decline to quit!” thundered the Advertising
Manager.</p>

<p>“All right then, STAY!” said the Boss with
a sudden calmness. “We can get along together.
<i>We are onto each other.</i>”</p>

<h2>HOT SKETCH NO. 24<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Export Group Grafter</span></small></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a><br /><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>


<p class='drop-cap'>ON A crisp and crackling December morn,
a Jones Farm sausage with a big cigar
and deep-dish collar of four-flusher fur,
swished into the office of Messrs Eazley Skinned
&amp; Co., Manufacturers.</p>

<p>He took out a race-track amplifier and
announced that he was about to make a trip
all the way to Europe in the interest of a
group of Non Competitive manufacturers and
would be pleased to let one other Representative
Firm in on this satin-faced opportunity.</p>

<p>Now the office of Messrs Eazley Skinned &amp;
Co., was a placid, tooth-picking sort of a place.
The business had been passed down the aisle
from sire to son so many times that it had begun
to wear slick in spots like the plush seat of the
collection box. The whole place breathed of
Longtime Service but very little business.
Whenever the door opened every bucolic head
in the room turned toward it like a Grammar
School class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The sudden announcement, therefore, that
somebody was about to proceed on a hazardous
journey to a far-off place like Europe created
no little stir in this hive of hustle. We do
not mean by this that it unleashed as much
excitement as an Order would have done, or a
Wall Street Bomb. But it was sufficient to
start every pair of eyes forward from their
bushings including those shrewd gray see-ers of
Mr. Eazley Skinned himself.</p>

<p>The breezy visitor was immediately ushered
into the private office of Mr. E. Skinned who
put on his coat and reached for the trusty box
of 5-scenters, calling meanwhile to the other
shirt-sleeved Executives who came filing in.
Soon every chair was tilted back comfortably
and the fumes of the hemp panetella rent the
air, so to speak. The show was about to
commence.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” began the Weenie with the
Collar, “the trip I am about to make will cover
<i>all</i> of Europe.” He paused to let it sink in.
Ernie Shackleton could not have done more.</p>

<p>“And the group of manufacturers I shall
represent will have my Undivided Attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
I shall represent <i>only</i> the interests of the firms
who are fortunate enough to sign up with me,
and no other firm in America will be able to
induce me to give them one single bit of trade
information, no matter how many tears they
shed.”</p>

<p>At this juncture nobody in the meeting
thought to ask His Fur Collar how many firms
he intended to represent. So he didn’t volunteer
the information that he was out for a neat total
anywhere from 40 and 4,000.</p>

<p>Then spoke up the President in an inquiring
crescendo. “Just what cities, or whatever you
call them over there, do you intend to visit?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Every metropolis in Europe,” flashed back
the intrepid explorer as he began spreading a
map of South Africa out over the desk, tracing
with a pencil the various points he would touch
on his daring expedition provided the domestic
touch proved good enough to enable him to do
so.</p>

<p>“I will sail from New York here (pointing
to Cape Town) on the Acquatoonia on January
1st and my passage alone will cost me $350.00<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
for a 7-day trip or $50.00 a day before I even
get to London. There it will cost me anywheres
from $25.00 to $30.00 a day at the <i>Sav</i>-voy
without counting Roast Lamb from the push-cart
at Simpson’s which I understand is listing
somewhat and from there I will cross the Channel
to Paris and the channel trip alone will cost
me $75.00 easily, and the tipping in Paris is
fierce since the War.”</p>

<p>Here the coherent and logical trade commissioner
was again not interrupted by anybody
asking him if he had ever been in any of
these places before, or had ever sold goods
anywhere else on the face of the earth. So
he very sensibly kept still on these points and
continued to talk about the fierce expenses at
every town he proposed to back into.</p>

<p>If any of his discriminating hearers at any
time during the informing Foreign Trade discourse
were interested enough in their own
financial welfare to go through the enervating
ordeal of dropping their chairs forward a few
inches to take a look at his old bluff-map, he
was not aware of it. Nor did any of them
appear to wish to interrupt his forceful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
lucid presentation of his program by asking
him How About Orders or any other irrelevant
thing like that.</p>

<p>They all merely puffed the old cabbagio, chins
up and eyes on ceiling, and swung their legs as
they watched the smoke rings float away from
the bunk. Mr. Eazley Skinned broke in at one
stage to tell about the big tips that Mrs. Eastbrook
and her husband Jim Eastbrook said it
cost them that time when they went to Euripp.</p>

<p>Things were coming along great and grand
for the Bright Lad with the Grab Bag; so of his
own accord he continued to elaborate his story.
He told how he would distribute their catalogues
and Price Lists wherever he went, and
make regular monthly reports, and he explained
how all orders that would flock in from the New
York Export Houses would naturally be the
result of his efforts and how the factory was to
simply credit him with the commission on each
shipment since he wouldn’t have time to always
check up, being so busy selling goods all the
time and so forth.</p>

<p>The Boss of the works here ventured to inquire
how much that commission was going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
be, and the Wise Gink modestly said 5%
because he was leading up to something else.
The Boss said 5% was fair enough and all whiskers
around the room nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>“Now then,” said the Dominating Personality
as he came pounding down the final
stretch, “in order to help defray a part of my
expenses each manufacturer will be asked to
pay $500.00, and in order to avoid the delays
and expense of remitting, this amount will be
paid by each one in advance.”</p>

<p>At this every tilted chair around the room
suddenly and concertedly hit on all four
cylinders and a few hep coughs and sideglances
were exchanged, but there was no show of
disapproval—merely surprise.</p>

<p>Observing this, the Globe Trotter jumped
right into the breach fur collar and all, and
began telling them all once more about the
fierce expenses and explaining how he himself
was going to stand 50% of the cost of the trip
while the firms he represented would only be
stuck with 50% all bunched together.</p>

<p>It was cheap, dirt cheap, for all they would
get, and he was not charging in his time either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>—simply
the actual cash outlay that he would
have to suffer without an anaesthetic in travelling
such costly terrytory. And the tips! Great
Gamaliel, those tips!</p>

<p>To hear that boy unfold the thrilling drama
of Europe’s Tipping Evil was like listening to
a tale of Armenian Massacre. You just
couldn’t help but thank God that you were right
at home, safe from all tipping harm. Whenever
he thought he saw one of his hearers struggling
to get that Five Hundred Dollar Retainer past
the adams-apple, he would come on again with
another shower of Expenditures. He spent
thousands of dollars for tips inside thirty
minutes.</p>

<p>It is a custom of the Spanish arena to let the
biggest and bravest bull out last. Likewise our
heroic Trade Toreador saved up his best sword
thrusts and wild waving of the red-lined cape
until the last act.</p>

<p>And he was some bird at that! When he
concluded, there wasn’t a whisker around the
room that wasn’t trembling with suppressed
excitement. Dream pictures of million-dollar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
single orders floated before the glassy eyes of
every hypnotised galoot in the conference.</p>

<p>Mechanically they got up one by one and
filed out of the room to hold a secret caucus
before announcing their momentous decision.
When the last nice, large, fat head had disappeared
through the doorway, our hero got
out his Memo Book and entered another $500.00
to his credit. He had them wirestitched and
he knew it.</p>

<p>Inside 5 minutes they all filed slowly in
again, took their places around the room, tilted
back their restful time-passers once more, and
drew long complacent puffs at the binder twine
perfecto.</p>

<p>The President then arose, dropped some
ashes on his vest, rubbed them slowly into it
with his left hand, stroked his patriarchal
pampus-grass with his right, and announced
that they had decided to go in as one of the
Elect.</p>

<p>Everything settled, he then announced to his
confreres, in strict accordance with popular
custom, that it might not be a bad idea to call
the Export Manager in and get his opinion.</p>

<p>So in popped the little Rascal with his Atlas
and all, loaded to the ear-peaks with catch questions
for the garrulous Grafter. One of the
clerks had slipped out long ago to the little
typewriter-desk at which the Export Manager
sat, to tell him what was going on in the Directors’
Room and so he was loaded for sea-lions.</p>

<p>But when he heard that the whole thing was
already settled, he closed up like a spring trap
which made the Firm think he knew even less
than he did about anything. At that he was
wise for he had nothing to gain and would only
have got the brilliant new Foreign Representative
sore at him at the getaway instead of
later on which is the customary time for Foreign
Travellers to plot for the destruction of Hon.

peculiar metallic ring of the Generality-Report,
just as though each of the ten manufacturing
suckers had received an exact copy, were received
every month for a few months.</p>

<p>Then about the fifth month they began to
shrink in size and promise. About the seventh
month, Dear Firm got merely a post card. It
was a picture of the Moulin Rouge, and merely
wished them a Merry Xmas. After that they
received regularly each month nothing more
than a sharp twinge in the big toe.</p>

<p>One aromatic Spring morning as they were
all sitting together in tooth-picking complacency
talking about things in general, a bright young
